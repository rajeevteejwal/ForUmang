This has the potential to impact individual securitisation transactions in many ways. For example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the value of underlying assets may be significantly reduced</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>cash flows from underlying assets may be interrupted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the ability to enforce security over underlying assets may be affected by (initially) temporary measures introduced at a national level</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>underlying assets, and/or the securitisation itself, may be downgraded or put on negative watch by credit rating agencies (CRAs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>there may be breaches of the tests included in the securitisation documents which relate to the underlying asset pools, such as overcollateralisation tests, interest coverage tests and borrowing base tests, or other events may be triggered, such as margining events, and cure rights may be exercised</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Events of this kind may require to be reported under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Regulation (EU) 2017/2402</a> (the Securitisation Regulation). The Securitisation Regulation requires:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>regular provision of information on the underlying assets (quarterly for transactions which are not asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) securitisations, monthly for ABCP securitisations)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>ad hoc reporting, without delay, of inside information and significant events</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reporting requirements may be fulfilled by the originator, sponsor or special purpose securitisation entity (SSPE) of a securitisation (the reporting entity).</p>\n<p>The information to be made available quarterly or monthly is highly detailed and is specified in the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Annexes</a> to <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Commission Delegated Regulation of 16 October 2019 supplementing the Securitisation Regulation with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the information and the details of a securitisation to be made available by the originator, sponsor and SSPE</a>. It includes information for each individual underlying asset. The impact of the pandemic may potentially add significantly to the burden on reporting entities. For example, in relation to residential mortgage-backed securitisations, the information to be reported for each underlying mortgage includes the following, which would have to reflect payment holidays granted by lenders in accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> to firms on mortgages and the coronavirus:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>restructuring, which means any changes made to the contractual terms of the underlying asset due to forbearance, including payment holidays, arrears capitalisation, change of interest rate basis or margins, fees, penalties, maturity and/or other generally-accepted measures of restructuring due to

precise nature, which has not been made public, relating, directly or indirectly, to the SSPE or the securitisation, which, if it were made public, would be likely to have a significant effect on the price of the securitisation notes.\n</p>\n<p>The requirement to report significant events applies to all securitisations within the scope of the Securitisation Regulation.</p>\n<p>Article 7(1)(g) of the Securitisation Regulation sets out a non-exhaustive list of events which would be considered significant events:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a material breach of the obligations provided for in the transaction documents, including any remedy, waiver or consent subsequently provided in relation to such a breach</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a

standardised (STS) securitisations, where the securitisation ceases to meet the STS requirements or where competent authorities have taken remedial or administrative actions, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>any material amendment to the transaction documents</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Examples of events which may potentially constitute significant events in relation to a securitisation are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>test breaches such as overcollateralisation tests, interest coverage tests, borrowing base tests, margining events and the exercise of any curerights</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>material breaches of transaction or warehouse documents</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span

class='label'>•</span>\n<p>to comply with the requirement to report inside information, the reporting entity is required to make an assessment as to whether the information in question would be likely to have a significant effect on the prices of the securitisation notes—this assessment may be difficult to make in, for example, a situation where the number of restructured underlying loans in arrears changes daily, and where prices generally, and the price of the securitisation notes specifically, may in any case be highly volatile</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the requirement to report inside information or a significant event may be triggered by an accumulation of individual events, such as payment holidays and arrears on underlying loans, which are also required to be included in the information to be reported quarterly or monthly—however there is no provision in the Securitisation Regulation for delaying the reporting of the inside information or significant event until the quarterly or monthly report is made</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further information on reporting requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Securitisation Regulation—essentials — Ongoing transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Securitisation Regulation—monitoring</h3>\n<p>One of the aims of the Securitisation Regulation is to make institutional investors take responsibility for evaluating the securitisations they invest in. The requirement for reporting entities to report detailed information on a periodical basis and inside information and special events as they occur is balanced by a requirement for institutional investors to carry out ongoing monitoring of their investments in securitisations.</p>\n<p>Detailed monitoring requirements are set out in Article 5(4) of the Securitisation Regulation and include a requirement to perform regular stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying assets or, in the absence of sufficient data on cash flows and collateral values, stress tests on loss assumptions, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the risk of the securitisation position.\n</p>\n<p>Institutional investors should therefore be taking a proactive approach to the pandemic and the information provided by reporting entities.</p>\n<p>For further information on monitoring requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Securitisation Regulation—essentials — Due diligence, risk assessment and ongoing monitoring</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>MAC clauses and force majeure</h3>\n<p>Material adverse change (MAC) and force majeure clauses are sometimes found in securitisation documents, for example, in servicing agreements where they relate to the servicer’s capacity to perform under the servicing agreement. Typically, the triggering of a clause of this kind would be grounds for terminating the servicing agreement. Where they are found, there is no standard wording. It is therefore advisable to review existing transaction documents to see if they contain MAC or force majeure clauses, or clauses with similar effect which are not specifically identified as MAC or force majeure (for example, ‘disruption events’) and, if a clause of this kind is found, consider very carefully the language used and its application to the specific circumstances of the servicer or other party to which it relates against the background of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The wording of a MAC clause in a servicing agreement will typically focus on a deterioration in the financial or other condition of a specified party—eg the servicer—while a force majeure clause will typically focus on external events which impair the ability of specified party to perform under the contract. However, both could potentially be triggered by a major external event such as the pandemic.</p>\n<p>For general guidance on the interpretation of MAC clauses, see Q&amp;A: <a href='#'>What are the implications of coronavirus (COVID-19) for MAC clauses in facility agreements?</a>\n</p>\n<p>For general guidance on the interpretation of force majeure clauses, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19), force majeure and frustration—Key legal principles and industry implications</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Specific issues...</h3></section></section></section></section></section></section>",

Most of its provisions are in force from 26 June 2020.\n</p>\n<p>The aim of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> is to promote a rescue culture to ensure companies in financial difficulties have greater opportunities to restructure and avoid formal (more often than not, terminal) insolvency processes during the coronavirus crisis and beyond. It is therefore a comparatively debtor friendly piece of legislation. It legislates for temporary measures announced by the government as part of its coronavirus response but, more significantly, it introduces permanent new tools into the UK corporate insolvency and restructuring framework, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a new stand-alone moratorium which will impact on secured lender enforcement rights</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a new restructuring plan which includes cross-class cram down provisions which can be used as an alternative to schemes of arrangement or company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), and </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the restriction of the use of termination clauses allowing for a contract for supply of goods or services to a company to be terminated in the event of the company entering an insolvency process</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As such, it is one of the most significant pieces of legislation in this arena this century.</p>\n<p>The government previously consulted on the permanent changes to the UK’s insolvency regime and its response was published on 26 August 2018 (see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Exploring the government’s response to the insolvency and corporate governance consultation</a> and Practice Note: <a href='#'>Reform of UK insolvency laws</a>). <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> largely follows the conclusions set out in that response in terms of the permanent measures. Because it was enacted on an accelerated timetable and will not have been put through the usual level of scrutiny, it contains powers for the Secretary of State to amend and add to the legislation as necessary to take account of drafting or practice issues.</p>\n<p>In this Practice Note, we provide summary information on the changes to insolvency and restructuring law set out in <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> with a view to drawing out key issues and discussion points for lenders and provide further reading links for those wishing to dig into the detail of the new legislation.

The aim is to give the company breathing space to allow a restructuring to be implemented (for example, through a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan (see below), CVA or informal restructuring). The directors would remain in charge of the company but the process and company conduct during the moratorium is overseen by a monitor (an insolvency practitioner) who is required to certify that it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.\n</p>\n<p>The moratorium will not be available if the company has been subject to an insolvency procedure/moratorium within the past 12 months and a court order would be required to commence the moratorium where the company is currently subject to a winding up petition. Some of these criteria have been relaxed on a temporary basis until 30 September 2020 on account of the impact of coronavirus on businesses. Certain companies (eg most parties to capital markets arrangements, public-private partnership project companies, and some financial institutions) cannot use the moratorium procedure. In addition, the Insolvency Act 1986 Part A1 Moratorium (Eligibility of Private Registered Providers) Regulations 2020, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2020/652</a> ensure that the standalone moratorium does not apply in relation to companies which are private registered providers of social housing given housing legislation already contains measures to deal with businesses that get into financial difficulty—including a moratorium. Foreign companies will be able to use the procedure but must apply to court and be able to show sufficient connection to the jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>The moratorium provides the company with a payment holiday from certain debts which fell due before the moratorium or fall due during the moratorium but relate to obligations incurred pre-moratorium. However, some debts are excluded and must be paid as they fall due (Non-Payment Holiday Debts) including liabilities arising under a contract or instrument involving financial services—this includes bank facilities, capital market arrangements, commodities contracts, derivatives contracts, guarantee commitments and any contract secured by a financial collateral arrangement.</p>\n<p>The process will be commenced by the filing of forms at court without the requirement for a court hearing and initially lasts for 20 business days, with the possibility of extension by the directors for a further 40 business days and, thereafter, further extensions can be made with the consent of certain creditors (pre-moratorium creditors whose debt is subject to a payment holiday) and/or the permission of the court. The moratorium is extended while a CVA is pending and can be extended by the court until such date as the court orders where a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan is proposed. The monitor is required to file documents at Companies House confirming the entry, extension or end of the moratorium, and is also required to notify known creditors. There is no requirement to notify qualifying floating charge holders (QFCHs) or to obtain their consent to the moratorium.</p>\n<p>The monitor must terminate the moratorium if they think the company is unable to pay Non-Payment Holiday Debts. In addition, the company must pay the Non-Payment Holiday Debts to obtain an extension (unless the extension triggered by a restructuring procedure).</p>\n<p>If the company goes into an insolvency process within 12 weeks of the end of the moratorium, unpaid Non-Payment Holiday Debts have super priority in any distribution from the insolvency process. Provision is made temporarily (until the later of 30 September 2020) for the order of priority to be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>amounts owed in respect of goods and services supplied during the moratorium where the supplier was not able to use an ipso facto clause to terminate supply</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>wages and salary</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>other debts and liabilities apart from the monitor’s remuneration and expenses, and then</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the monitor’s remuneration and expenses</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additional provision is made for the Insolvency Rules 2016 to be amended to set out the priority in which super priority debts are to be treated among themselves.</p>\n<p>A restructuring plan, CVA or scheme of arrangement commenced within 12 weeks of the end of a moratorium cannot apply to a Non-Payment Holiday Debt without the consent of the relevant creditor. This could give lenders veto rights in relation to any scheme or CVA.</p>\n<p>Restrictions are placed on the company’s ability to enter into transactions during the moratorium, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no new credit can be incurred in excess of £500 unless the lender is informed about the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the company cannot enter into certain financial instruments (market contracts or financial collateral arrangements, transfer orders, market charges or a system-charges, or collateral security)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>new security can only be granted with monitor consent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>secured property may only be disposed of (i) if the disposal is in accordance with the terms of the security/agreement, or (ii) with the permission of the court if the court thinks such sale would support the rescue of the company as a going concern. Where the court gives permission:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>if the property is subject to a fixed charge, the company must apply the net proceeds (which the court may determine as net proceeds which would be realised on a sale at open market value) towards discharging the secured debt, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>if the property is subject to a floating charge, the floating charge holder will receive the same priority in respect of the sale proceeds as they had in the floating charge asset</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where monitor consent is required for such transactions, it can only be given on the basis that the action will support the rescue of the company as a going concern.</p>\n<p>The moratorium is similar to the administration moratorium as far as action against the company is concerned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no insolvency proceedings may be commenced, other than on an application by the directors or on public interest grounds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>except with court permission (which cannot be sought to enforce a pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>no steps may be taken to enforce security—though enforcement of financial collateral arrangements, such as security over shares is permitted, as is enforcement of security which was granted with monitor consent during the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>no proceedings/legal process may be commenced or continued against the company or its property; no landlord may exercise any forfeiture right; no steps may be taken to repossess goods under any hire-purchase agreement</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In contrast to the administration moratorium, a creditor looking to enforce its debt must apply to court—there is no provision to allow the directors or the monitor to consent to enforcement of debt. Further, only creditors in respect of Non-Payment Holiday Debts may apply to court to lift the moratorium (therefore lenders can apply to court to enforce their debt and/or security, but creditors whose debts are subject to payment holidays cannot).</p>\n<p>In addition, in relation to floating charges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a provision in a floating charge instrument is void if it provides for the obtaining of a moratorium, or anything done with a view to obtaining a moratorium, to be (a) an event causing the floating charge to crystallise, (b) an event causing restrictions which would not otherwise apply to be imposed on the disposal of property by the company, or (c) a ground for the appointment of a receiver</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no floating charge may be crystallised by a floating charge holder, nor can a floating charge holder place any new restrictions on the company’s disposal of its assets (and a floating charge holder cannot apply to court for permission to take such action)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if a floating charge document requires notice of crystallisation to be given within a set time frame which ends during the moratorium, the notice can be served as soon as practicable after the later of the end of the moratorium or the date the charge holder is notified of the date of the end of the moratorium. The event will be treated as occurring on the date the crystallisation notice is given</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further reading on the moratorium, see: <a href='#'>Moratorium—overview</a> and Practice Note: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—moratorium</a>.</p>\n<p>See also Practice Note: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—impact on CVAs</a>.</p>\n<table border='0' role='presentation'>\n<tbody xmlns:lnv='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lnv' xmlns:lnvxe='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lnvxe' xmlns:pgs='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/pgs'>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='0%'> </td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='100%'>\n<span class='boldtext'>Key issues/discussion points</span>\n<br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='0%'> </td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='100%'>\n<span class='boldtext'><em>Impact of the moratorium on lenders:</em></span>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Companies which are parties to agreements forming part of a capital markets arrangement of more than £10m</span>—these companies are unable to use the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Loan repayment</span>—the company will still be required to make loan payments (interest, charges and capital) as they fall due during the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Events of default and acceleration</span>—the moratorium itself will (in most cases, depending on the drafting of the events of default clause) trigger an event of default giving the lender the ability to accelerate the debt.

However, in practice lenders are likely to still have influence and some control. This is because, if the lender accelerates the debt during the moratorium, the full debt (not just payments falling due before or during the moratorium period (eg interest, charges, capital repayment due in the ordinary course) will fall due for payment as a Non-Payment Holiday Debt. If the company is not able to pay the full debt, the moratorium must terminate.

The impact on private M&amp;A transactions will probably go beyond the period of the pandemic itself as regards the impact on the economy and individual businesses. Specific consequences that directly result from the pandemic include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>financial viability of conducting an acquisition—given the economic upheaval and shock to the world economy, will buyers have the necessary available funds to carry out a private M&amp;A transaction? A potential buyer may look to maintain or bolster its cash reserves rather than seek out acquisition opportunities as a means of prudent financial management to weather the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>heightened transaction risk—there is increased risk for a buyer in concluding a transaction during a time of extreme volatility, which could lead to the buyer overpaying for its acquisition target or acquiring what transpires to be a flawed asset. Distressed sales once the effects of the pandemic have played out may provide better valuations and decreased risk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>valuation difficulties—this is linked to the point above and covers the difficulty the buyer will face in carrying out an accurate assessment of the value of the target company or business/assets (target) it looks to acquire (as per comments above, valuation may be easier to determine at a later date and/or under a distressed sale)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>delays in deal activity—as described above, rather than proceed with a purchase of a given target while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, buyers may opt to wait for the value of such target to decrease over time owing to the effects of the pandemic and then acquire the relevant target at a discounted price, ie wait for the target to become a distressed asset</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>increased focus on existing business—companies may find themselves more occupied with ensuring during the COVID-19 pandemic that their existing operations remain on a sound financial footing rather than pursuing any deal activity (although it could prompt sales if the seller’s group is under financial pressure as a result of COVID-19)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From a practical standpoint, the various ‘lockdown’ or ‘stay at home’ measures which have been imposed across the world by various governments due to COVID-19 will have an effect on how private M&amp;A transactions are conducted. Negotiations will have to be conducted virtually over telephone and video conference, although it is also likely that in many circumstances negotiations between principals to agree headline terms at the outset of the transaction will simply be delayed until meetings can occur face to face. As considered in this Practice Note, the eventual execution of the transaction documentation would need to occur entirely remotely. Looking to a post-coronavirus environment, remote execution may become more standard as parties adapt to the ‘new norm’.</p>\n<p>For a general overview of the key issues that may arise for corporate practitioners in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—key issues for Corporate lawyers</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_826622'></mark>Due diligence</h2>\n<p>Before acquiring the shares in a private limited company/unlisted public company or a business and its assets, a potential buyer will want to carry out due diligence to gather information about the target it is seeking to acquire. As part of this due diligence exercise, the potential buyer may also want to carry out a specific COVID-19 due diligence exercise concerning the exposure of the target to COVID-19 risks, both in the short-term and the longer-term. This exercise, in tandem with the buyer’s due diligence findings on other aspects of the target, will provide the required information for the buyer to decide whether or not to proceed with the acquisition based on the risks, liabilities and value identified through this due diligence exercise.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Data rooms</h3>\n<p>From a purely practical standpoint, the various ‘lockdown’ or ‘stay at home’ measures which have been imposed across the world by various governments mean that while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, the prospect of a buyer conducting due diligence through the use of physical data rooms will be highly unlikely. The same will apply to certain steps which a buyer may typically undertake as part of its due diligence process, such as site visits to the target’s various premises and physical meetings with target management. It is therefore likely to be necessary for the seller to put in place a virtual data room to house due diligence material, ie an online (often cloud-based) repository and document sharing platform to give the buyer and its advisers access to the documents and information that they need to conduct their due diligence exercise in relation to the target. There may also be practical challenges for the seller in compiling this virtual data room, ie the seller may need to arrange for its personnel to access target premises which have been closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, in order to access and physically upload onto the virtual data room site due diligence materials relating to the target.</p>\n<p>Where a data room is not envisaged, there will still potentially be many practical difficulties that the seller would face in collating responses and appropriate documentation in response to the buyer’s due diligence enquiries while lockdown measures are in place (or while movement and access to all the target’s sites and offices is restricted or hampered).</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Issues to focus on in due diligence</h3>\n<p>Key issues that the buyer will seek to explore during due diligence include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>financial impact of COVID-19 on the target—the buyer should explore in due diligence the viability of the target’s continuing operations due to the effects of COVID-19. In particular, the buyer may look to explore the extent to which the target benefits from governmental schemes to aid businesses during the pandemic, such as the UK’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>operational and trading impact of COVID-19 on the target’s suppliers/customers—this will be linked to the point above and will involve a buyer exploring to what extent the operations of the target’s business will be affected, eg the extent to which the following may be compromised:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>suppliers&apos; continuing ability to provide goods and/or services to the target, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>customers’ continuing ability to buy goods and/or services from the target</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>financing arrangements—the buyer should examine the terms of the target’s credit facilities carefully, to assess whether the economic effects of COVID-19 may cause the target to breach the terms of its facility agreement (any prior or potential breaches of financial covenants may lead to the target ceasing to have access to credit funds post-acquisition) and therefore consider whether the buyer would be able to fund any resulting financing shortfall from its own cash/financing arrangements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>material contracts—the buyer should examine key contracts entered into by the target, eg with key clients and suppliers, to ascertain whether the terms of such contracts have been breached and assess the risk attached to any future breach of contract (by any one contract party) flowing from COVID-19 impact. This is always an important element of due diligence in an acquisition but the level of risk is likely to be heightened (potentially for a prolonged period) and therefore may pose substantial risk to the target and the acquisition (depending on the nature of the target’s business and contracts involved)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>IT infrastructure—given the need for the vast majority of businesses to have effective remote/virtual working capabilities in place (both immediately in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially more generally in the future if working patterns continue to be altered), the buyer will need to examine the target’s IT arrangements to ensure that the business is properly equipped to function in an environment where its personnel work remotely from home. Other areas which the buyer would seek to cover as part of this review include, the examination of the target’s business continuity arrangements, disaster recovery plans and insurance arrangements (see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Business continuity plan—BCP—a practical guide</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>employees—in addition to ensuring the target’s staff are able to work remotely from home, the buyer will wish to review any arrangements the target has put in place in relation to its employees due to the economic effects of COVID-19, eg plans to furlough employees, offer unpaid leave, offer sabbaticals, reduce working days/hours, etc. Here, the buyer will look to assess the risks of the target undertaking these arrangements</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many of the assessments that any buyer must make while conducting due diligence are fraught with multiple uncertainties, in particular as regards the length of time that the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on all forms of economic activity and behaviour and the time that it will take for these impacts to play out as regards impact on the target’s business.</p>\n<p>For further information on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (original version to 30 June 2020)</a>. For further information on the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, see Q&amp;A: <a href='#'>What is the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and how can borrowers access it?</a>\n</p>\n<p>For further information on due diligence in a private M&amp;A context, including on the use of physical and virtual data rooms, see Practice Notes: <a href='#'>Due diligence—share and asset purchases</a> and <a href='#'>Data rooms—share and asset purchases</a>.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_826623'></mark>Consideration</h2>\n<p>The following factors, among others, are likely to be relevant in determining the level of consideration the parties agree on in respect of the target:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>difficulties in valuing the target—valuing the target is likely to be more difficult given all the uncertainties in the economy and therefore poses an increased risk for the buyer. The buyer is likely to place a greater emphasis on the most up to date financial information relating to the target, to assess how the target is coping financially as near as possible to the time of the deal’s conclusion. The buyer may therefore insist on more fulsome management accounts relating to the target and push for more comprehensive warranties. In addition, the buyer is likely to have a higher degree of difficulty in valuing targets engaged. Acquisitions in sectors that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, such as travel, restaurants and the retail sector will pose the greatest risk for any buyer, not least because of uncertainty as to whether the business will remain financially viable throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond. Distressed sales may ultimately prove more likely therefore</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>deal structuring adjustments—due to various uncertainties flowing from the pandemic, including the overall impact on a potential target, the buyer may look to defer a portion (or a greater portion than typically seen) of the consideration, as a means in some instances for the buyer to defer questions of valuation until after the transaction’s completion, thus permitting the buyer to form a more accurate picture of the target’s value which takes into account the post-completion effects of COVID-19. The buyer may therefore seek to include provisions for post-completion adjustments to the consideration. Conversely, the seller will be likely to argue for as much of the consideration as possible to be in the form of cash, especially if it is a distressed seller due to the ravages of the pandemic. The buyer may look therefore to pay part of the consideration up front and the rest in instalments post-completion or may opt to have part of the consideration subject to an earn-out, whereby part of the purchase price is calculated by reference to the future profits and performance of the target for a specified period following completion. For further information on such consideration adjustment mechanisms, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Consideration adjustments (completion accounts, locked box and earn-outs)—share and asset purchases</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>difficulties in raising acquisition finance—due to COVID-19, there is far less credit available in the market for potential buyers. This is likely to affect the ability of a buyer to raise acquisition finance and likely to have an effect, in particular, on management buyout transactions where bank debt often forms a key part of the transaction. Buyers with significant retained cash reserves are therefore more likely to be active in the market and favoured by sellers looking to dispose of shares or assets. For further information on such matters, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19) implications for Banking &amp; Finance lawyers</a> and the sections dealing with <a href='#'>General lending</a> and <a href='#'>Leveraged finance</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>share consideration and equity finance—if the buyer is a listed company and is looking to allot/issue shares to the seller as either full or partial consideration for the acquisition of the target, this will pose a risk to the seller because the volatility of the markets due to COVID-19 may act to reduce the value of the shares offered to the seller (and indeed the buyer’s own share price may be underperforming relative to the market as a whole). Sellers are therefore likely to prefer cash consideration more than in normal market conditions. Similarly, if the buyer is looking to conduct an equity capital raise, such as a rights issue or open offer, to raise funds for the purchase of the target, this may also prove difficult due to current market conditions. However, the buyer’s shares could still prove an attractive form of consideration for the seller if the buyer’s prospects have improved for whatever reason (including where the buyer’s strong balance sheet/cash reserves make it a relative safe haven). Similarly, if such companies are looking to raise funds in the capital markets to fund acquisition opportunities, such equity raises may prove attractive</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>buyer’s ability to fulfil obligations—given the disruption to the world economy caused by COVID-19, the seller may have concerns about the buyer’s ability to meet its obligations in any deal, especially in cases where some or a substantial part of the consideration is deferred post-completion. In this respect, the seller is likely to be more insistent on including mechanisms in the deal documentation to allay any such concerns The seller may insist on part of the consideration being placed in an escrow account post-completion to meet future buyer payment obligations under the documentation or that the buyer’s parent company (if any) provides a guarantee for the buyer’s obligations</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_826624'></mark>Conditions to completion</h2>\n<p>A buyer is more likely to insist that any deal to acquire a target is carried out on a conditional basis (the SPA/APA setting out the conditions that must be satisfied before completion can take place, with a gap in time between exchange/signing, at which time the SPA/APA is signed, and the later completion of the acquisition). Bolstering the conditionality of the agreement allows the buyer to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the business post-signing and prior to completion and allows it, subject to the drafting of such conditions, to either amend the deal agreed or withdraw from the transaction. Conversely, the seller will be keen for signing and completion to be simultaneous, to avoid any risk that the deal is amended or terminated post-signing, especially if it is in a distressed situation due to COVID-19. In this regard, the seller may be thwarted in this desire due to the severity of the pandemic’s effects on the world economy (for example if it needs the sale proceeds to bolster its own finances). For information on the issues that normally arise in private M&amp;A transactions where there is a split exchange and completion, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Issues arising where there is split exchange and completion—share and asset purchases</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Regulatory approvals</h3>\n<p>If the transaction is subject to regulatory clearance, such as merger control laws at a national or at an EU level, the buyer will typically seek to include a condition in the SPA/APA for such transaction to be approved by the relevant authorities prior to the transaction completing. Merger review processes are being impacted worldwide as merger control authorities adapt to take account of the consequences of COVID-19. Given the turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many cases may face changes in approach and practice. For example, there could be delays in certain circumstances in obtaining regulatory approval for such transactions, it being highly likely that extended review timetables will be imposed by the relevant authorities in respect of such transactions. This may need to be factored into the transaction planning and documentation, perhaps by having a later long stop date (see below) or by ensuring such date can be easily extended. If any such delays are likely to be significant, a seller may be less willing to sell to a buyer who is required to seek such regulatory approvals.</p>\n<p>At the EU level, the Commission is encouraging merging parties to delay notifications and discuss timing of transactions with the relevant case teams, as the Commission is facing difficulties in collecting information from the parties and the market (eg customers, competitors and suppliers). Requests for information that stop the clock or instances of ‘pull and refile’ cannot be excluded. However, the Commission will review cases in which parties can show very compelling reasons to proceed with a merger notification without delay (the Commission has been accepting simplified filings).</p>\n<p>At the UK level, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will continue to progress ongoing merger investigations and has issued guidance on its approach to merger assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CMA is not asking merging parties to delay notifications, but is encouraging parties to consider whether some filings could be postponed (eg if a merger is not particularly well-advanced and may not ultimately proceed). Pre-notification talks may take longer because of difficulties in obtaining information from the merging parties and from third parties. The CMA will continue to use its power to issue mandatory information requests with deadlines. However, the CMA recognises that staffing shortages or remote working environments may make it harder for companies to meet mandatory deadlines for producing information. The CMA is unlikely to exercise its statutory finding power in such cases. However, the CMA may stop the clock if merging parties are unable to provide information in due time. In terms of substance, the CMA has confirmed that its review standard will not be relaxed and that interim measures will still be imposed when necessary. Given the economic impact of COVID-19, the CMA has also restated its approach to the ‘failing firm’ defence (the CMA expects firms to claim more frequently that the target is failing, but will maintain the established (demanding) standard for establishing that a firm is ‘failing’). All meetings are being conducted remotely via videoconferencing or telephone, and the CMA is well prepared for remote working following a recent upgrade in technology infrastructure.\n</p>\n<p>For further information on how the review process from a UK competition perspective may be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19) and application of UK competition law</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Material adverse change (MAC)</h3>\n<p>A buyer may wish to insert a material adverse change (MAC) clause into any SPA/APA it concludes for the transaction, thereby giving it a right to terminate the agreement if there is a MAC which affects the business between exchange and completion. This will usually be something which is of significance to the buyer and will be aimed at addressing unforeseen risks, other than breac...</p></section></section></section></section></section></section>",

For more information, see the Practice Note: <a href='#'>Limitation—the principal limitation periods—Saving for other limitation enactments</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It has been said that <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a> was intended to constitute a complete code, such that it provides exhaustively for the circumstances in which limitation defences may or may not be taken (<em>Chagos Islanders v A-G</em>, see para [45]) subject to the express saving for ‘other limitation enactments’ at <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980, s 39</a> and the defences which are peculiar to equity (see <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980, s 36</a> and Practice Note: <a href='#'>Limitation—the principal limitation periods—Claims for equitable remedies</a>).\n</p>\n<p>However, it is important to be aware that the parties might have agreed to vary a limitation period applicable to a claim. For example, parties can seek to agree a shorter limitation period (subject to any appropriate controls concerning the limitation of liability, as to which, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Exclusion and limitation of liability</a>). In addition, it is possible that a defendant will be precluded from relying on a technically available limitation defence since, for example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the defendant might have contracted not to take any such defence, or have specifically agreed to a longer limitation period than would otherwise apply. In particular, the parties might have entered into a standstill agreement to suspend or extend limitation (see <a href='#'>below</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the defendant might be otherwise estopped from invoking such a defence. In <em>Saunders v Caerphilly County Borough Council</em>, the court held that it would be unconscionable for the defendant to take a limitation defence since it was implicit in the correspondence that no limitation point would be taken\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>likewise, the court held that it would be an abuse of process to permit Pakistan’s limitation defence to certain restitutionary claims in <em>High Commissioner for Pakistan in the UK v Prince Mukkaram Jah</em> (see paras [280]–[285]). The abuse was said to arise out of a combination of: i) Pakistan’s assertion of sovereign immunity, which had previously prevented the defendants’ claims from being made; ii) Pakistan’s waiver of that immunity by the bringing of a claim over the same property which the defendants’ had a claim; and iii) the assertion against those rivals claim of a limitation defence that it had been open to Pakistan not to take. The paragraphs in Pakistan’s statements of case asserting the limitation defence were struck out accordingly. For further information on that case, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>After more than 70 years, the heirs of a beneficiary are entitled to his trust fund (High Commissioner for Pakistan in the United Kingdom v Prince Mukarram Jah, His Exalted Highness The 8th Nizam of Hyderabad and others)</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_132972'></mark>Determining the limitation period</h2>\n<p>It is important to determine when a limitation period expires and therefore it is critical to understand when the limitation period started and whether that date can be postponed under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>When time runs from</h3>\n<p>Time will start to run at different points for different causes of action. Typically, the date that a cause of action accrues will be pertinent: for example, time runs from the date of breach in simple contract claims.</p>\n<p>In considering what is meant by the phrase a cause of action, the Court of Appeal in <em>Read v Brown</em> affirmed the definition &apos;every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the court&apos;. As set out in <em>Hayes v Butters</em>, ‘a cause of action is, in modern parlance, a set of facts that entitles the claimant to relief’ (see para [56]). To determine the date from which limitation runs, you will often therefore need to understand all the legal ingredients of your claim and identify the point from when it could be said that each of those elements (ie every fact which is necessary to be proved) had been fulfilled. Depending on the nature of your claim, such process can be difficult and/or open to argument (see, by way of example, <em>McLoughlin v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire</em> at paras [52]–[54]).\n</p>\n<p>For more information on the limitation periods for the different types of claims, see Practice Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation—the principal limitation periods</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation—contract claims</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation—tort claims</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation—professional negligence claims</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation—constructive trust claims</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Certain general principles for the computation of time have also emerged. In particular, when calculating the expiry of a limitation period, parts of days are typically ignored. In <em>Marren v Dawson Bentley</em>, the claimant had been hurt in an accident at 1.30 pm on 8 November 1954 and issued proceedings on 8 November 1957. Havers J held that the claim had not become time-barred at the end of 7 November 1957 since, when a cause of action accrues during the course of a day, that day is disregarded when calculating the running of time.\n</p>\n<p>However, in the event that a cause of action accrues on the stroke of midnight, and so is completely constituted at the very first moment of a particular day, that day should not be excluded from the calculation for <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a> purposes—see the Court of Appeal judgment in <em>Matthew v Sedman</em>, upholding the findings of HHJ Hodge QC in the High Court, and referencing <em>Gelmini v Moriggia</em> as good law on this point. There are no ‘fractions of days’ to be disregarded in ‘midnight deadline’ cases. For more information, see News Analyses:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Limitation and the stroke of midnight (Matthew v Sedman)</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>High Court considers limitation when cause of action accrues at midnight (Matthew v Sedman)</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>When does time stop running?</h3>\n<p>Once time starts to run, the general long-standing rule is that nothing can interrupt it (<em>Purnell v Roche</em>), despite the fact that such principle can have some seemingly harsh consequences. However, time may be interrupted if, for example:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>there is a statutory provision to that effect (for example, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>AA 1996, s 13(2)</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>there is a deliberate concealment by the defendant of a material fact after the cause of action has accrued (<em>Sheldon v Outhwaite</em>). If after the accrual of the cause of action a defendant takes steps to conceal relevant facts, the claimant will have the full limitation period applicable to that cause of action within which to bring their claim, starting from the date of discovery of the concealment. For further information, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Limitation—fraud, deliberate concealment and mistake</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Time stops running for limitation purposes when the claim is &apos;brought&apos;. It is important to be aware that this is the date the claim form (together with the correct court fee, discussed further <a href='#'>below</a>) is received by the court for the purposes of issuing it and not the issue of the claim form itself, which is the start of the proceedings for most purposes (<a href='#'>CPR PD 7A, paras 5.1</a>, <a href='#'>5.2</a> and <em>Barnes v St Helens</em>). In the event that the expiry of a limitation period is imminent, it is therefore sensible to request that a duplicate copy of the claim form and/or covering letter be stamped by the court office, and to retain such stamped copy as evidence of the date when the claimant’s request for the issue of a claim form had been received (<em>Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Vahora</em>).\n</p>\n<p>Further, as a general rule, if the last day of the prescribed limitation period falls on a day when the court office is closed for the whole day (for example, a Saturday), the statutory period will be construed as ending not on that day, but on the next day when the court office is open (<em>Pritam Kaur v S Russell</em>).\n</p>\n<p>The same principle was applied in <em>Calverton Parish Council v Nottingham City Council</em>, which concerned the time period for bringing a claim under the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, </a>and in <em>Yadly Marketing Company Ltd v Secretary of State for the Home Department</em>, about the statutory period for bringing an appeal pursuant to the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006</a>. In the later case, the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the time for filing an appeal could be construed as ending on a day when the court office was closed, because the act in question was the filing of a document, which required no involvement of the court and so the document could be filed by inserting it through a letterbox or under a door of the court. In rejecting this submission, the Court of Appeal stated that not only were the documents in question required to be taken to the court office (as opposed to being posted through a letterbox), but that to encourage the filing of documents in this manner would create uncertainty (not least, the court in question might not have a letterbox) and risk the documents being mislaid.\n</p>\n<p>However, <em>Croke v Secretary Of State For Communities and Local Government</em> provides a reminder not to leave the issue of a claim to the last minute. In that case, the claimant sought to issue the claim by attending court five minutes before the office closed on the last day of the limitation period, and alleged that he had been refused entry to the court building by security. The claimant relied on <em>Calverton</em> to suggest that, since he was denied entry to the court while the court office was open, it was not functioning and he should therefore have been permitted to issue proceedings on the next day when the court office was fully accessible. Robinson HHJ rejected this argument, relying on comments of Lord Neuberger in <em>Mucelli v Government of Albania</em>, in which he stated, obiter, that, in contrast to where the court office is closed for a whole day, where the court office is open during normal office hours but is closed before midnight on the final day of a limitation period (as will always be true of the court), a litigant can have no cause for complaint that he was unable to file the claim outside normal office hours, and time is not extended until the next day, so long as the court office was open during normal office hours. Robinson HHJ noted that litigants whose claims are subject to strict time limits must make arrangements to ensure that they attend the court office in good time so that they are not thwarted by any unexpected problems.\n</p>\n<p>For further information on how to issue a claim form, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Claim form—filing and issuing</a>.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_339044'></mark>Failure to pay the correct court fee</h2>\n<p>Following the Court of Appeal case <em>Barnes</em>, a number of authorities have considered if a claim has been brought for limitation purposes where an incorrect court fee has been paid. In particular, in <em>Page v Hewetts Solicitors</em>, it was held that the claimants had not done all that was required to commence proceedings before the limitation period expired since the claimant had failed to pay the correct court fee on issue and the mistake was not spotted until after the limitation period has expired. For more information on this decision, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Claims time-barred due to wrong fee and failure to follow up (Page v Hewetts)</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Where the underpayment of the court fee is due to court staff error, the claimant may nevertheless be able to show that he has brought the claim for limitation purposes. In <em>Bhatti v Asghar</em>, Warby J reviewed the previous authorities dealing with a failure to pay the correct court fee, including <em>Page</em>, and concluded that they identified a clear principle by which the court is to determine whether a claim has been brought for the purposes of stopping the limitation period from running. In particular, he considered that principle to be that a claim is brought ‘when the party concerned has done all that is in his power or to set the wheels of justice in motion&apos; and this will ordinarily include &apos;proffering the correct fee to the court office at the same time as presenting the claim form’, but if there has been a failing on the part of the court (for example, if the court assumed the burden of calculating the correct fee and made an error) this might lead to the claim having been brought in circumstances where the correct fee was not paid. For more information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Underpayment of court fee and effect on limitation (Bhatti v Asghar)</a>.\n</p>\n<p>However, note the criticism of Warby J&apos;s summary of this principle in <em>Dixon v Radley House Partnership</em>, in which Stuart-Smith J concluded that payment of &apos;the appropriate fee&apos; at the time of issue as calculated by reference to the value of the claim set out in the original claim form (and particulars of claim if served together) is sufficient to stop time running for limitation purposes and that, in the absence of abusive behaviour, the appropriate fee is not to be determined by reference to claims articulated at a later stage, whether or not the claimant intended to bring those later claims at the time of issue. For a more detailed consideration of this case, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Claim not statute barred because of payment of incorrect court fee (Dixon v Radley House)</a>.\n</p>\n<p>In the later decision of <em>Wells v Wood</em>, the County Court reviewed all of the above authorities and concluded that none of these cases supported the view that a claim form issued and sealed by the court (regardless of the fee paid) is ineffective to stop the limitation clock. The judge referred to the distinction between bringing a claim for limitation purposes and starting a claim (as elucidated in <a href='#'>CPR PD 7A, paras 5.1</a>, <a href='#'>5.2</a>) and concluded that:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘…while there may be questions yet to be answered on how payment of the incorrect court fee affects the bringing of a claim for limitation purposes where the Claim Form is issued outside the limitation period, that is not what I am dealing with here. In the application before me the Claim Form was issued within the limitation period and in my judgment with that step the claim was both brought and started…</p>\n<p>In my judgment questions of payment of court fees are primarily between the paying party and HMCTS. Such matters may become of interest to other parties where it is alleged that there is abuse of process or in the particular circumstances of investigating whether a party has done all in its power to set the wheels of justice in motion so as to have brought the claim before issue…</p>\n<p>In the current case, the payment of the wrong fee at issue had no effect on the validity of the Claim Form or its stopping of the limitation clock. It was a matter which needed correcting and that has now happened.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Effect of payment of incorrect court fee on limitation (Wells v Wood)</a>.</p>\n<p>The misgiving expressed by Stuart-Smith J about the course embarked on by the courts post <em>Page</em> were also echoed in the case of <em>Atha &amp; Co Solicitors v Liddle</em>. Despite the claimant&apos;s solicitor&apos;s apparent abuse of court process in those proceedings, by deliberately undervaluing the claim to pay a smaller court fee, Turner J concluded that the claim had nonetheless been ‘brought for limitation purposes at the time the claim form was received by the court and not when it was later issued’. He added ‘by way of postscript’ to his judgment though that ‘…the proliferation of irreconcilable first instance decisions over the last few years is such that the time is now ripe for authoritative guidance from the Court of Appeal’. For further information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Limitation and deliberate underpayment of court fee (Atha &amp; Co Solicitors v Liddle)</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Note also that the court in <em>Glenluce Fishing Company v Watermota</em> referred to the evolving case law concerning the effect of underpayment of the court issue fee and the significance of this in considering whether the claim has been brought for limitation purposes and stated that such authorities should be limited to applications to strike out claims and was not to be extended to cases concerning applications to amend a claim under <a href='#'>CPR 17.4</a>. For more information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Payment of the incorrect court fee, limitation and applications to amend (Glenluce Fishing Company v Watermota)</a> and Practice Note: <a href='#'>Limitation—amendments to statements of case and counterclaims</a>.\n</p>\n<p>For further information on the payment of court fees, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Court fees in civil proceedings</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_335220'></mark>Abuse of process</h2>\n<p>There is authority to suggest that it can be considered an abuse of process if a claimant deliberately understates the value of a claim so as to reduce the court fee payable on issue (<em>Lewis v Ward Hadaway</em>). If the limitation period expires before the appropriate fee is paid, the claimant might also be found not to have brought the claim within the limitation period for the purposes of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a> and the claim may therefore be summarily dismissed. For more information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Dangers of deliberate understatement of claim value to reduce court fee (Lewis v Ward Hadaway)</a>.\n</p>\n<p>However in <em>Wiseman v Marston&apos;s</em>, the County Court allowed an appeal against a decision to refuse a claimant permission to amend a claim form to increase the quantum of damages sought (which increased the court fee payable) after the expiry of the limitation period. In this case the court held that there was no abuse of process. The solicitor had issued the claim close to the limitation period where counsel had been unable to advise on quantum prior to the effluxion of the limitation period and, once the increased value was known, an application to amend was made promptly. In addition, with liability having been admitted by the defendant, the injustice to the claimant in not permitting the amendment would have been significant. For more information on this case see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Paying the correct court fee: strike out or amendment? (Wiseman v Marston’s)</a>. Also of note is the refusal of Jackson LJ to permit a second appeal of this decision, in which he stated that this case was ‘quite unlike’ <em>Lewis</em>, in which there was ‘deliberate conduct designed to avoid paying the correct fee’.\n</p>\n<p>Further, in <em>Atha</em>, Turner J expressly declined to follow the reasoning in <em>Lewis</em> in a case where it appeared that the claimant&apos;s solicitors had deliberately understated the value of the claim in order to reduce the court fee. He noted that the court retains the power to strike out a claim ‘in the event that the abuse is sufficiently egregious’, but that the conduct in the present case fell ‘very short of such a level’. He concluded that the incorrect payment of the court fee, even though deliberate and an apparent abuse of process, had no impact on the timing of the issue of the claim and ‘it would be wrong to permit the provisions of [<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a>] to be deployed as a tool of retrospective and disproportionately draconian discipline’. For further information, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Limitation and deliberate underpayment of court fee (Atha &amp; Co Solicitors v Liddle)</a>, as well as Practice Note: <a href='#'>Strike out for abuse of process (civil) (CPR 3.4(2)(b))</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Note that it may in addition be considered an abuse of process to issue a protective claim for limitation purposes when, at the time of issue, there is no valid basis for the claim being made other than to stop time running (<em>Nomura International v Granada Group</em>). In contrast, it is not abusive to bring a claim that is prima facie time-barred, since limitation is a matter to be raised in defence and there could be cause to argue that the standard limitation period should not apply in the circumstances (see the comments of Nicklin J at para [53] of <em>Churchil v Open College Network South Eastern Region</em>, as well as <a href='#'>below</a> for further information on the effect of a limitation period expiring).\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_444931'></mark>Standstill agreements</h2>\n<p>In the event that there is a prospective claim and the end of the limitation period is approaching, the parties should consider entering into an agreement, known as a standstill agreement, to suspend the running of the limitation period or extend the limitation period to a specific date. These agreements are frequently encountered in (but by no means restricted to) the sphere of professional indemnity litigation. Their purpose is usually to permit time for investigation, compliance with a pre-action protocol and/or to allow negotiations to take place without the need for the claimant to issue what might later turn out to be unnecessary, or at least premature, protective proceedings. They will commonly preserve any crystallised limitation defence and be subject to termination on a specified period of notice and/or date.</p>\n<p>Where parties enter into negotiations prior to the bringing of a claim, it is important for the claimant to be aware of any potential limitation defence and to consider whether a standstill agreement might be necessary. Without the benefit of specific agreement it can prove difficult for a claimant to demons...</p></section></section></section></section></section>",

This will usually be a date later than when the original limitation period was due to end, however this type of agreement can also be used in cases where there is uncertainty or a dispute about when the limitation period will end in order to clarify the limitation position rather than meaningfully extend the period within which any relevant claim(s) can be brought</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_494438'></mark>Using a limitation suspension agreement—a practical illustration</h2>\n<p>The following is an illustration of how a limitation agreement to suspend the running of limitation can work.</p>\n<p>The limitation period by which Party A must bring their claim against Party B expires on 31 January 2021, and the limitation period within which Party B could bring its claim against Party A expires on 15 February 2021. In late November 2020, say, Party A and Party B might still be investigating their claims and still attempting to resolve some, if not all, of the issues in dispute. Neither party will want to incur the cost and time of issuing claims and/or counterclaims if they can help it.</p>\n<p>The parties could enter into a suspension agreement on, say, 30 November 2020 by which they agree to suspend the running of limitation from that date until either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>some future unspecified date when the suspension ends pursuant to service of a termination notice of the suspension agreement, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>15 April 2021</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>whichever is the earlier of the two dates.</p>\n<p>If they choose this suspension option, it means that time will start to run again once the suspension ends, such that the portion of the limitation period which was unexpired as at 30 November 2020 would continue to run once more. In the above scenario, if the suspension period ends on 15 April 2021, then Party A would have (roughly) two months from 15 April 2021 in which to commence proceedings and Party B would have (roughly) two and a half months in which to issue its claim against Party A.</p>\n<p>This scenario appears relatively straightforward. However, it is important to ensure that the provisions concerning the method of service of a termination notice are clear and are understood. The parties should have in mind the risk of a termination notice not being received, especially if deemed service of a termination notice by way of a single communication is agreed. It is possible that the agreement could be terminated, and the limitation period may re-commence, without the notice of termination actually having been received by the appropriate person (for example, if the notice is lost in the post or is signed for by an inappropriate person).</p>\n<p>The key points in relation to suspension agreements are generally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>ensuring clarity on the scope of the dispute(s) to be covered by the agreement and in identifying the relevant parties</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>ensuring that the drafting makes clear that neither party can issue proceedings during the period of suspension</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>identifying the period of the suspension and the mechanism for, as well as the consequences of, terminating that period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>ensuring that the risk of non-receipt of a termination notice has been considered</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is additionally useful to keep in mind <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>section 35</a> of Limitation Act 1980 (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>LA 1980</a>) and the limitation position on bringing counterclaims.

Evidence suggests that the virus can exist for up to 72 hours on surfaces. For this reason, Public Health England recommends trying to keep two metres away from people outside your household as a precaution, or one metre when you can mitigate the risk by taking other precautions.

In his <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>speech on Sunday 10 May 2020</a>, the Prime Minister announced that, to chart progress, there would be a new Covid Alert System, run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre, with five alert levels; having been in Level Four during lockdown, he announced then that we were ‘now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three’. The first such step is a ‘change of emphasis’, from saying ‘you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must’ to saying &apos;work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home’; anyone who cannot work from home, eg in construction or manufacturing, should be ‘<em>actively encouraged</em> to go to work’. The Cabinet Office <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> published the following day, 11 May 2020, clarified that:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>for the foreseeable future, workers should continue to work from home rather than their normal physical workplace, wherever possible, but</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>all workers who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> was updated on 12 June, but this wording remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>The government has since relaxed the rules set out in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2020/350</a> relating to which businesses and venues must remain closed, and replaced those Regulations with the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No 2) (England) Regulations 2020, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2020/684</a> (see: <a href='#'>Current restrictions on businesses</a> below).\n</p>\n<p>This change of emphasis was taken into account in updates to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>advice for employers and employees</a> made on 13 May which, in a section headed ‘<em>If someone does not want to return</em>’ says:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>some people might feel they do not want to go to work, or might be unable to return yet, eg because they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>worried about catching coronavirus</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>at high risk of getting a severe illness if they catch coronavirus</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>caring for children, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>living with someone who is &apos;shielding&apos;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>an employer should listen to any concerns staff may have and should take steps to protect everyone, eg they could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>offer extra car parking where possible so that people can avoid using public transport</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>keep someone on furlough if they are temporarily unable to work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>arrange for someone to work different hours temporarily to avoid peak time travel</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if an employee still does not want to go in, they may be able to arrange with their employer to take the time off as holiday or unpaid leave.

Failure to do so is a criminal offence. This core duty extends to the provision of plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health, and the provision of such information, instruction, training and supervision as is necessary to ensure the health and safety at work of employees. It is important to remember that this duty extends to both physical and mental health.\n</p>\n<p>An employer must also conduct their business in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that people not in their employment who may be affected by it are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. Failure to do so is a criminal offence.\n</p>\n<p>&apos;Reasonably practicable&apos; means that the courts will recognise that the duty is qualified. A balance needs to be achieved between the degree of risk in a particular job or workplace against the time, cost and physical difficulty of taking measures to avoid or reduce the risk. At one extreme, if it would take a lot of time, cost or effort to reduce a very small risk, then the measure would not be reasonably practicable. At the other, if the time, cost or effort would be minimal to prevent a high-risk event from happening, then the step would be reasonably practicable. The grey area in between is where most focus should be given, and in practice businesses will need to conduct a risk assessment to identify the hazards which may arise from the activity, the likelihood of the event occurring and identify the steps which could be taken to eliminate or reduce that risk to an acceptable level. The assessment will assist in determining whether a particular step would be reasonably practicable—as well as providing evidence to justify that decision should it subsequently be questioned.\n</p>\n<p>For further information, see: <a href='#'>Health and safety—overview</a> and Practice Note: <a href='#'>Safety and the risk to safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974</a>.</p>\n<p>For information on the Acas <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance on coronavirus and mental health at work</a>, see: <a href='#'>Acas mental health guidance</a> below.</p>\n<p>An employer’s duties in relation to health and safety are non-delegable; the employer cannot leave it to an employee to decide whether a situation is safe or not, nor is it sufficient for the employer simply to say that they followed government guidance. However, if an employer does not follow government guidance as a minimum, that might constitute evidence of failure by the employer to comply with its health and safety duties.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this section deals with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>relevant BEIS guidance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the TUC report: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Preparing for the return to work outside the home</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the PHE guidance: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Stay at home: guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>whistleblowing considerations, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the toolkit published by the Society of Occupational Medicine (SOM), Acas, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), Business in the Community, and Mind: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Returning to the workplace after the COVID-19 lockdown</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>BEIS guidance</h3>\n<p>According to the BEIS <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>announcement</a>, the stated purpose of the BEIS <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance on working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> is to help UK employers get their businesses back up and running and workplaces operating as safely as possible.

This includes workers advised to ‘shield’ and those who are pregnant. If these workers cannot work safely, their livelihoods must be protected.

The EHRC must ensure that the return to work strategy seeks to prevent this disproportionate impact and complies with the public sector equality duty</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>unions should be consulted when the government prepares sector-specific guidance, and when employers seek to implement it (according to the TUC blog: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>The government’s back to work plans still won’t make workplaces safe—here’s why</a>, BEIS did consult unions on the first draft of its return to work guidance; the first draft was poor, and the unions demanded immediate and substantial changes; although the published guidelines ‘aren’t everything unions wanted, they are a step in the right direction’)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the HSE must run a public information campaign to ensure workers know their rights.

Many people have had to make significant changes to their daily lives, at relatively short notice, including how they work—whether that is hours, location, or even being able to do their job at all. Nobody knows how long this situation will last, but it is clear that the impact will be felt for years to come</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>employers cannot force their employees to return to work if it is unsafe. There is a duty on employers, HR, occupational (OH) professionals, and employees to understand how to make the workplace safe, their role in that process, and the need to be involved and work together in making those decisions. Decisions about return to work should occur in a non-discriminatory way</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a risk assessment should link clinical vulnerability risk to specific workplace risks. Employers also need to be aware of the risks of increased workplace tensions and disputes, arising from changes to workplace practices and working arrangements, and from fear of infection on return to work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>occupational health and other professionals can assist managers with risk assessments, eg with advice on cleaning, disinfection, ergonomic and hygiene or ventilation systems and how ‘stringent social distancing’ can be applied in the workplace</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the role of the manager and ‘doing things in a compassionate way’ is critical.

See also Precedent: <a href='#'>Health and safety risk assessment</a>, which is aimed at an office-based working environment.</p>\n<p>As mentioned <a href='#'>above</a>, the government <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> states that employers must carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in line with <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>HSE guidance</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in consultation with workers or trade unions, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>sharing the results of the risk assessment with its workforce and on its website</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of the eight workplace-specific guides states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not strictly entirely correct, since:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the employer recognises an independent trade union for collective bargaining purposes, the employer must consult the union-appointed safety representatives under the Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 (1977 Regulations), <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 1977/500</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if there is no recognised trade union or no trade union safety representatives have been appointed and/or there are employees who are not represented by safety representatives under the 1977 Regulations, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 1977/500</a>, the employer must consult the workforce either directly or through elected health and safety representatives (known as &apos;representatives of workplace safety&apos;), under the Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 1996/1513</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further information, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Health and safety—employer consultation and employee representatives</a>.</p>\n<p>The workplace-specific guides also state that the employer <em>must</em> share the results of its risk assessment with the workforce and, if possible, consider publishing the results on its website. Before 24 June (23 June in the case of the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a> guidance) the guidance was that employers <em>should</em> do so—see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—guidance tracker for employment—BEIS guidance: Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>. They go on to say that the government ‘would expect all businesses with over 50 workers to do so’. However, there is currently no legal obligation on employers to publish their risk assessments on their website.</p>\n<p>The workplace-specific guides also state (since 15 June 2020) that the government would expect all businesses to demonstrate to their workers and customers that they have properly assessed their risk and taken appropriate measures to mitigate this, by displaying a notification in a prominent place in their business and on their website, if they have one.</p>\n<p>This does not go as far as the demands set out in the TUC <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>report</a>, which sought that, before easing lockdown restrictions, the government would require all employers with more than five staff to carry out a specific COVID-19 risk assessment, and require them to publish that risk assessment.\n</p>\n<p>In the absence of any penalty or other negative effect, some employers may decide not to meet the government’s ‘expectation’ in this regard, unless they take the view that doing so would enhance the reputation of the business, or raise confidence of employees, customers or clients visiting its premises. However, increased employee awareness of the government’s expectations may lead to workforce pressure for publication.</p>\n<p>The <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> also prominently encourages workers to report suspected breaches of the guidance to the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE).</p>\n<p>The TUC <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>report</a> also set out that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>employers should work with unions and workers to assess the risks in the workplace, and set out specific steps, including enforcing social distancing, for how these can be mitigated and how workers can work safely</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>risk assessment should factor in the likelihood of continuing absences across any business, and the availability of any safety-critical staff; while the rate of absence remains high because of sickness, self-isolation or other factors, output may need to be adjusted to safeguard employees’ mental and physical health</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the COVID-19 risk assessment should be approved by an accredited union health and safety representative or, where there is no such representative able to sign off a risk assessment, by an HSE inspector</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>once agreed, risk assessments and action plans must be sent or otherwise effectively communicated to the whole workforce before they are expected to return to work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the risk assessment shows that PPE is necessary, employers must provide it; where the necessary PPE cannot be supplied, work should not recommence. No-one, including PHE, should require health and social care workers to re-use PPE; PHE and the HSE should also rescind their guidance allowing for the reuse of certain items of PPE in exceptional circumstances of scarcity</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to TUC blog: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>The government’s back to work plans still won’t make workplaces safe—here’s why</a>, there are still big questions about how public transport can be managed safely for passengers and transport workers alike and that, without childcare, going back to workplaces will be impossible for many.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_830344'></mark>Other considerations affecting the decision to re-open</h2>\n<p>Now that most businesses and venues are able to re-open, the likelihood is that business will not immediately return to normal levels of customer or client demand, eg in the case of restaurants, pubs and bars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>workplaces are advised to make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines (ie two metres, or one metre with risk mitigation where two meters is not viable), which will almost certainly limit the number of customers that can be accommodated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>having been warned of the serious implications of contracting the coronavirus and the need to ‘stay home’, it may take the public time to want to socialise, particularly if they think the venue will be too crowded</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>returning customers may be unwilling to meet the requirements identified in the relevant guidance or in the business’s own risk assessment, eg providing personal information so that the business can keep a record of its customers to assist NHS Test and Trace, or booking a table or queuing simply to have a drink at a pub</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown has, for many, been severe, and many households will not be able to afford to spend on ‘leisure’</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the high level of staff and other costs involved in running a restaurant or pub, businesses in this sector usually need a certain amount of customer turnover in order to make a profit; additional staff costs may be incurred if they need to employ dedicated staff to encourage social distancing or manage security, as the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a> guidance suggests. If reduced capacity or turnover means the business will not break even, they may choose to open for fewer days or hours than usual, or remain closed altogether until restrictions are eased further. In any event, employers may need fewer staff and/or staff working reduced hours.</p>\n<p>As the CJRS scales down after 31 July (and ends on 31 October), employers will need to assess:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>whether it is viable to open the business under social distancing guidance, and to what extent (eg whether service should be on...</p></li></ol></section></section></section></section></section>",

The case concerned a number of electricians on a large construction site. Working conditions at the site were far from satisfactory. It was very wet and there were insufficient facilities for the workers to dry out their work clothes. There was very heavy rain which produced wide areas of standing water on the marshy ground around the site. It was also very cold. During the lunch break, the workers expressed widespread and spontaneous concerns about the adverse effects of the weather on working conditions and they resolved to approach management to let them take the afternoon off in order to dry out. It was decided that C, the AEEU shop steward, and T, a spokesperson for the TGWU members, should approach management with their concerns. They did so but with no success. The project manager dismissed the requests out of hand, believing that the men were simply attempting to get money without work. The men then decided to leave the site. The men did not work on the following day (Wednesday), nor again on Thursday, although they attended the site in the morning. When they clocked in to work on Friday, they found that conditions, though improved, were still not satisfactory and they refused to go back to work. The employers had already decided that if the men failed to return to work on Friday, they would all be dismissed. Consequently, as they left the site at 1pm, they were all given letters of dismissal. They brought tribunal proceedings alleging automatically unfair dismissal, and general unfair dismissal, which the tribunal upheld.\n</p>\n<p>The EAT allowed the employer’s appeal against the finding of automatically unfair dismissal. In order for this statutory provision to come into play:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>it is necessary to show that it was not reasonably practicable for the employee to raise the health and safety matters through the safety representative or safety committee</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the employee must have brought to the employer&apos;s attention by reasonable means the circumstances that they reasonably believe are harmful or potentially harmful to health or safety, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the reason for dismissal, or at least the principal reason if there is more than one, must be the fact that the employee was exercising its right</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In considering the first requirement, the EAT held that, although on its face the statute requires an employment tribunal to ask whether it was reasonably practicable to use a safety representative rather than asking whether it was reasonable for the employee to use some other means of communicating with the employer, it would be highly artificial if, when drawing matters of serious and imminent concern to the employer, the employees must concern themselves with the appropriate route by which that information is conveyed. The important thing is that the message is communicated quickly and succinctly. This is supported by the fact that <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Directive 89/391/EEC</a>, the Framework Directive on Health and Safety (Framework Directive) provides in terms that workers must ‘immediately inform the employer’ of serious and immediate dangers to health and safety. It is clear that an employee exercising their obligations under Article 13 of the Directive cannot conceivably be lawfully dismissed under English law on that account.\n</p>\n<p>The employment tribunal was therefore entitled to find that it was reasonable for the employees to raise their concerns through their union representatives, even though it would have been practicable to use the safety representatives as the channel of communication.</p>\n<p>However, taking industrial action is not ‘reasonable means’ of bringing health and safety concerns to the employer’s attention. Nor can it amount to ‘informing’ the employer within the meaning of the Framework Directive. Although in exceptional circumstances, communication can be by action rather than words, the concept of informing the employer cannot extend to taking industrial action to impress upon the employer the gravity of the issue as perceived by the employees.</p>\n<p>The employment tribunal had erred, therefore, in holding that the applicants had used reasonable means to draw their concerns about health and safety matters to the employers&apos; attention by going out on strike and refusing to return to work. Accordingly, the applicants were not protected under the automatically unfair dismissal provisions.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_833497'></mark>Leaving work in the face of serious and imminent danger</h2>\n<p>It is unlawful to subject any employee (ie the employee does not need to be a safety representative in order to be protected) to a detriment, and any dismissal will be automatically unfair, if the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for the detrimental treatment and/or dismissal is that, in circumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent and which they could not reasonably have been expected to avert, the employee:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>left or proposed to leave, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>(while the danger persisted) refused to return to</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>their place of work or any dangerous part of their place of work.</p>\n<p>‘Dangers’ in this context are not limited to dangers arising out of the workplace itself, but also cover dangers caused by the behaviour of fellow employees.\n</p>\n<p>In <em>McCaffrey</em>, the employee (M) left his workplace, where he was working a nightshift with one other employee (H), when H became very abusive. M had attempted to report this to his manager from the work office but had not felt safe to do so, as H stood over him very closely and shouted abuse at him. M immediately went home and telephoned his manager from there. M also subsequently spoke to a more senior person in the company. M said that he would only return to work if he had assurances about his safety, which in effect meant H being removed or dismissed. However, without speaking to M further, the employer decided to accept H’s account of the incident. M was told by phone that he had resigned by walking out in the middle of the shift and that he would be sent his P45. The EAT upheld the employment tribunal’s finding that M’s dismissal was automatically unfair.\n</p>\n<p>Automatically unfair dismissal for leaving work in face in the face of serious and imminent danger was also claimed by the employees in <em>Acheson</em>, the facts of which are considered above (see <a href='#'>Raising health and safety concerns</a>, above).\n</p>\n<p>The employment tribunal found that the conduct did not fall within the statutory terms. It concluded that there was indeed serious and imminent danger on the Tuesday, or at least that was what the employees reasonably believed, but that by the Friday the weather had improved to such an extent that the circumstances of danger no longer existed. There was no appeal against that finding and so it was not considered by the EAT.</p>\n<p>The EAT noted, however, that the employees in that case could lawfully have taken industrial action without a ballot where they were, together, exercising their rights to leave work in face in the face of serious and imminent danger. It would also have been reasonable in all the circumstances for the employees to have impressed their views upon the employer in the way in which they did.\n</p>\n<p>See also the discussion of <em>Edwards</em>, under the heading ‘<em>Travelling to work</em>’, below.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_833498'></mark>Taking protective steps to avert serious and imminent danger</h2>\n<p>It is unlawful to subject any employee (ie the employee does not need to be a safety representative in order to be protected) to a detriment, and any dismissal will be automatically unfair, if the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for the dismissal and/or the detrimental treatment is that, in circumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent, the employee took (or proposed to take) appropriate steps to protect themselves or other persons from the danger.\n</p>\n<p>Whether steps which an employee took (or proposed to take) were appropriate is to be judged by reference to all the circumstances including, in particular, the employee’s knowledge and the facilities and advice available to them at the time.\n</p>\n<p>However, if the employer shows that it was (or would have been) so negligent for the employee to take the steps which they took (or proposed to take) that a reasonable employer might have dismissed them for taking (or proposing to take) those steps, the dismissal will not be automatically unfair, but may still be unfair on normal principles.\n</p>\n<p>In <em>Oudahar</em>, O was a chef employed by the Esporta Group a...</p></section></section></section></section></section>",

It has been relatively clear that:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>an employer may make an employee redundant while they are on furlough (the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>employee guidance</a> confirms this), but</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the CJRS grant cannot be used to fund the employee’s statutory redundancy payment (the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>employer guidance</a> confirms this)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What was not previously clear was whether the CJRS grant can be used to pay the employee’s wages during their notice period, as the HMRC guidance was silent on this point. We set out below the guidance from 10 July and the position as it may have been considered before 10 July, given the available guidance and the wording of the Treasury Directions.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>The guidance from 10 July</h3>\n<p>From 10 July, the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>employer guidance</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘You can continue to claim for a furloughed employee who is serving a statutory notice period…’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From 17 July, that wording is amended in the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>check which employees you can put on furlough guidance</a> to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘You can continue to claim for a furloughed employee who is serving a statutory <span class='boldtext'>or contractual</span> notice period…’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similar wording appears in the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>employee guidance</a>.</p>\n<p>It is therefore finally clear that, if an employee’s employment is terminated, whether by the employer or the employee, the employer can use the CJRS grant to pay the employee’s wages during their statutory or (longer) contractual notice period. This clarification is extremely welcome.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>The guidance (and Treasury Directions) until 10 July</h3>\n<p>Prior to 10 July, it was thought that the HMRC guidance’s silence on this issue might mean that the CJRS grant could be used to pay notice pay, but that there was a risk that this would not be regarded as within the ‘spirit’ of the CJRS. See, for example, Q&amp;As:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a href='#'>Can an employee who is currently on furlough under the coronavirus (COVID-19) job retention scheme be given notice of termination of employment?

It reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘2.1 The purpose of CJRS is to provide for payments to be made to employers on a claim made in respect of them incurring costs of employment in respect of employees <span class='boldtext'>who are within the scope of CJRS</span> arising from the health, social and economic emergency in the United Kingdom resulting from coronavirus and coronavirus disease.</p>\n<p>2.2 Integral to the purpose of CJRS is that the amounts paid to an employer pursuant to a CJRS claim are <span class='boldtext'>used by the employer to continue the employment of employees in respect of whom the CJRS claim is made whose employment activities have been adversely affected by the coronavirus and coronavirus disease or the measures taken to prevent or limit its further transmission</span>.’ [our emphasis]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This wording might appear to have potentially a very different effect from the wording in the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 2</a> set out above; if an employer gives a furloughed employee notice of termination of employment, can it be said that the employer is using the CJRS grant to ‘continue the employment of employees’ if the employer uses that grant to fund that employee’s pay during their notice period, which will bring their employment to an end, rather than continue it? In the absence of further guidance from HMRC, we were inclined to suggest that it could not.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_840040'></mark>Which employers are eligible</h2>\n<p>The revised CJRS from 1 July 2020 is only available to employers that have previously used the original CJRS, in respect of employees they have previously furloughed under the original CJRS.\n</p>\n<p>More particularly, a claim under the revised CJRS may only be made:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>by a <em>qualifying employer</em>, ie one who (as was the case under the original CJRS):\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>has a <em>qualifying PAYE scheme</em>, ie one that is registered on the RTI system, and was so registered on or before 20 March 2020, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>has made a <em>qualifying CJRS claim</em> on or before 31 July 2020, ie one that is made in accordance with the ‘original CJRS directions’ in respect of an employee who ‘ceased all work’ (ie was furloughed) for a minimum three-week period beginning on or before 10 June</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in respect of a <em>flexibly-furloughed employee</em> as defined in paragraph 10.1 of <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 3</a> (see: <a href='#'>Which employees the employer can put on furlough and claim for</a> below)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in a <em>CJRS claim period</em>, which must:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>begin and end in the same <em>CJRS calendar month</em> (ie July, August, September or October), and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>relate to a period of seven or more consecutive days, or to an ‘orphan period’</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ‘original CJRS directions’ are defined as <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 1</a> and <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 2</a>.

The repeating shift pattern is the regular working pattern a contract requires an employee to undertake in a periodic cycle in the course of the employee&apos;s employment, that specifies:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the number of hours the employee must work over the course of the cycle before the next cycle begins, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the number of calendar days in the cycle over which the hours must be worked (including days on which the employee is not required to work) before the next cycle begins</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, an example of a repeating shift pattern could be 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday (with Saturday and Sunday as non-working days), or 10am to 4pm, Tuesday to Thursday inclusive (with Friday to Monday inclusive as non-working days).</p>\n<p>However, the repeating shift pattern that is used for the calculation is the one having effect at the end of the latest salary period ending on or before 19 March 2020.</p>\n<p>This may mean for example that an employee who was placed on furlough under the original CJRS, then resumed work but on a short-time basis (ie with reduced hours) who is then furloughed again (flexibly) under the revised CJRS will have their pay for their furloughed hours calculated on the basis of their usual hours pre-19 March 2020, not the reduced hours they have been working more recently.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Employees on unpaid leave</h3>\n<p>As with the original CJRS, where an employee takes a period of unpaid sabbatical or other period of unpaid leave during the period beginning on 1 July and ending on 31 October, no claim may be made under the revised CJRS in respect of the period of unpaid leave.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Employees returning from family leave after 10 June 2020</h3>\n<p>Where an employee has been on maternity, adoption, parental, paternity or parental bereavement leave (family leave) for all or part of the period since the CJRS was first introduced, it may not have been possible (or necessary) for the employer to furlough them under the original CJRS; in that case, in the absence of some exception, they would be ineligible to be furloughed under the revised CJRS when they return.</p>\n<p>HM Treasury <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>announced</a> on 9 June 2020 that parents on statutory maternity and paternity leave who return to work in the coming months ‘after a long period of absence’ will be eligible for furlough scheme even after 10 June cut-off date.

<a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Check which employees you can put on furlough</a> guidance sets out four sets of circumstances where there has been a

rules</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the HMRC <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Check which employees you can put on furlough</a> guidance describes two sets of circumstances where the new employer is eligible to claim under the revised CJRS involving the <em>TUPE or PAYE business succession rules</em>. More specifically, these circumstances are set out in paragraph 37.6 of the Schedule to <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 3</a> as follows:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>where the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2003/2682, reg 102</a> has effect so that the change of employer from the former employer to the new employer is not treated as a cessation of employment for the purposes of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2003/2682, reg 36</a>, ie the employee remains in employment in the same business, and the new owner can take over the operation of the PAYE scheme without completion of a Form P45\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>where ‘<em>the transfer of the business or undertaking (or part thereof)</em>’ resulting in the change in the employee’s employer does not terminate the employee’s contract of employment by virtue of TUPE, or\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>where a transfer of the trade, business or undertaking resulting in the change in the employee’s employer does not break the employee’s continuity of employment by virtue of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>section 218</a> of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>ERA 1996</a>) (see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Continuity of employment—Change of employer</a>)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is unclear whether the second circumstance described above describes both types of relevant transfer under TUPE, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2006/246, reg 3(1)</a>, ie business transfers and service provision changes; the words <em>the transfer of the business or undertaking (or part thereof)</em> in <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Treasury Direction No 3</a> reflect the words: <em>transfer of an undertaking, business or part of an undertaking or business</em> in TUPE, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2006/246, reg 3(1)(a)</a>, which would suggest that service provision changes (described in TUPE, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2006/246, reg 3(1)</a>) are not covered. However, there would appear to be no rationale for employers not to be able to furlough employees who transfer by reason of a service provision change to which TUPE applies in the same way as they may furlough employees who transfer by reason of a business transfer. The position remains unclear, and it is to be hoped that HMRC guidance will provide clarification on this point in due course.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Employee transferred and

The employer must specify the days on which leave is or is not to be taken and, where the leave on a particular day is to be in respect of only a part of a day, its duration.\n</p>\n<p>On the face of it, therefore, the employer may effectively use the mechanism for giving notices and counter-notices under WTR 1998 to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>refuse a worker&apos;s request to take holiday at a particular time, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>direct an employee to take holiday at a particular time</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The BEIS guidance: <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Holiday entitlement and pay during coronavirus (COVID-19)—Taking holiday</a> reflects the above provisions of the WTR 1998 without further comment. This would suggest that, in BEIS’s view, an employer is free, during the coronavirus pandemic, to cancel a worker’s holiday or to require workers to take holiday, provided the notice requirements are met.

Equally, if the employee wants to change when they take this time off, they will need to get agreement from their employer.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>The fundamental purpose of holiday</h3>\n<p>The purpose of holiday, as mentioned in <a href='#'>The position under WTR 1998</a> above, under the heading ‘<em>The purpose of holiday</em>’ is to enable the worker to rest and to enjoy a period of relaxation and leisure.\n</p>\n<p>While the BEIS <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> acknowledges this ‘fundamental purpose’, it appears to do so only to the extent that the employer should consider whether any restrictions the furloughed worker is under (eg the need to socially distance or self-isolate), would prevent the worker from resting, relaxing and enjoying leisure time before requiring a furloughed worker to take holiday (see <a href='#'>below</a>).</p>\n<p>However, it is difficult to see why an employer should not also consider more generally whether those same restrictions would prevent any worker (not just a furloughed worker) from resting or enjoying a period of relaxation and leisure during the coronavirus pandemic. The social distancing restrictions have eased since they were first imposed on 26 March 2020, eg since 13 May people have been permitted to leave their homes for an extended list of reasons, including to visit a public open space for the purposes of open-air recreation to promote their physical or mental health or emotional wellbeing alone, with members of their household or with one member of another household. However, businesses providing holiday accommodation remain closed for leisure stays, and quarantine or ‘self-isolation’ restrictions are in place which will affect UK residents returning to the UK, which would affect anyone wanting to go on holiday other than (currently) within the UK, or to the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.\n</p>\n<p>Whether a period of holiday taken during the coronavirus pandemic would meet the fundamental purpose may depend, at least in part, on the worker’s personal circumstances; an individual who lives in a small flat or shared accommodation in the centre of a city without a garden, or access to the countryside or the beach may find it harder to find rest, relaxation and leisure while activities and travel are restricted than a colleague who has a garden and/or access to the countryside or the beach. A person who is shielding is unlikely to find relaxation or leisure while they are unable to leave their home or (from 1 June) advised to only spend time outdoors with members of their own household or, if they live alone, with one person from another household.\n</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_839676'></mark>How holiday pay is calculated</h2>\n<p>Under WTR 1998, during any period of statutory holiday a worker is entitled to be paid at the rate of a &apos;week&apos;s pay&apos; for each week of holiday, calculated in accordance with <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>sections 221</a> to <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>224</a> of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>ERA 1996</a>) (with certain modifications). For further information, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Holiday pay—Calculating statutory holiday pay: general</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Different methods of calculating a week’s pay apply, depending on whether the worker in question works &apos;normal working hours&apos; or &apos;no normal working hours&apos;.

The underlying principle is that a worker should not be financially worse off through taking holiday. Where they have regular hours and pay, their holiday would be calculated based on these hours; if they have variable hours or pay, their holiday pay is calculated as an average of the previous 52 weeks’ remuneration, excluding weeks in which there was no remuneration.\n</p>\n<p>For information on holiday pay for furloughed workers, see: <a href='#'>Furloughed workers</a> below, under the heading ‘<em>Holiday pay</em>’.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_839677'></mark>Carrying forward holiday entitlement</h2>\n<p>Changes to the rules governing the carrying forward, or carrying over, of holiday entitlement have been introduced to give employers more flexibility to manage statutory holiday obligations and staffing requirements during the coronavirus pandemic, and allow workers to carry forward up to four weeks’ basic holiday entitlement into the next two leave years if they have been prevented from taking their holiday because of coronavirus.\n</p>\n<p>These changes apply only to the four weeks of holiday provided for by the WTR 1998, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 1998/1833, reg 13</a>, and not the additional 1.6 weeks’ holiday provided for by WTR 1998, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 1998/1833, reg 13A</a>, which is subject to different carrying-over rules.\n</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the unamended WTR 1998 provides as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the four weeks’ basic holiday entitlement must, subject to certain exceptions established from case law, be taken in the leave year in respect of which it is due and may not be carried over from one leave year to the next.

From 1 August 2020 individuals will no longer be advised to shield, and those who cannot work from home will be able to return to work provided their workplace is ‘COVID safe’. Shielding individuals will no longer be deemed incapable of work for SSP purposes after 31 July 2020, which means their entitlement to SSP will cease unless they are ill or self-isolating.

The advice in the period 31 May 2020-5 July 2020 was:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>to stay at home as much as possible</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>to spend time outdoors for recreational purposes if they so choose, but to keep outdoor activity to a minimum (ie only once a day), accompanied only by household members or one person from another household (ideally the same person each time)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>not to enter other buildings, households or enclosed spaces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>to take extra care to minimise contact with others when outside, eg by keeping two metres apart</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>not to attend any gatherings (including gatherings of friends and family in private spaces), and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>strictly to avoid contact with anyone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (see: ‘<a href='#'>Symptoms of coronavirus</a>’, above)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the shielding guidance was first published, it advised that the shielding period was to be for a period of at least 12 weeks from the date of receipt of the letter from NHS England notifying the individual that they had been identified as being extremely vulnerable on medical grounds. In subsequent updates the guidance confirmed that the shielding measures were to be followed until 30 June 2020.\n</p>\n<p>On 22 June 2020, however, it was <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>announced</a> that the shielding period would be extended until 31 July 2020, albeit with protection advice gradually being eased after the end of June 2020.\n</p>\n<p>Subject to general public health measures being implemented to address a localised outbreak of the virus in a specific location, further steps to relax shielding guidance introduced 6 July 2020 allow those who are shielding:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>to meet in a group of up to six people outdoors, including people from different households, while maintaining strict social distancing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no longer to observe social distancing with other members of their household</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in line with the wider guidance for single adult households (either an adult living alone or with dependent children under 18) in the general population, to form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household.

The isolation note can be used to provide evidence following the appearance of coronavirus symptoms or if the person in question is living with someone who has coronavirus symptoms. For those who are self-isolating because they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus and they have been contacted by the NHS test and trace service, the notification from the NHS will suffice as evidence, and for those who are shielding, the letter from the NHS or their GP advising them to shield can be used (see: <em>Isolation notes and other evidence</em>, below)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further guidance on SSP generally, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Sick pay</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>SSP entitlement extended to those who self-isolate</h3>\n<p>In the normal course, one of the essential qualification requirements for SSP is that the employee must be too ill to undertake any work under their contract of employment on any day for which they claim SSP.\n</p>\n<p>However, not all infection or symptoms of illness necessarily render an employee incapable of working under their contract of employment. An employee may, for example, be obliged to stay at home for a period of time if they are self-isolating (see: <a href='#'>Self-isolation</a> above) , or if they are shielding.

Family practitioners are once again debating, as they did in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, whether an event of such magnitude is likely to constitute a ‘<em>Barder</em> event’ in financial remedy proceedings before the courts of England and Wales. This Practice Note re-examines that question at this turbulent and unprecedented juncture. It also considers alternative mechanisms for revisiting financial orders, the <em>Re Barrell</em> and <em>Thwaite</em> jurisdictions, as well as the civil law concept of frustration.\n</p>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_833200'></mark>Barder applications</h2>\n<p>If after a full hearing an aggrieved party complains that the judge fell into error, the appropriate avenue for challenging the order is by way of appeal. If, however, the complaint is not that the judge fell into error but rather relates to an unforeseen event or events that have occurred since the order was made, which fundamentally changes a central aspect of that order, then a so-called <em>Barder</em> application may be possible (per <em>Barder v Barder (Caluori Intervening)</em>).\n</p>\n<p>Such an application asserts that new events have invalidated the basis or fundamental assumption on which the financial order was made, making it appropriate to revisit that order. An application can be made in respect of consent orders as well as orders made after a contested hearing. See also Practice Note: <a href='#'>Setting aside financial orders including Barder events where no error of the court alleged</a>. \n</p>\n<p>A <em>Barder</em> application should be made in accordance with Family Procedure Rules 2010 (FPR 2010), <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2010/2955, 9.9A</a>, which was inserted by the Family Procedure (Amendment No.2) Rules 2016, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2016/901</a> with effect from 3 October 2016. This provides that the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>FPR 2010, SI 2010/2955, Pt 18</a> procedure applies to applications to set aside a financial remedy. This includes a <em>Barder</em> application. Pursuant to <a href='#'>FPR 2010, PD 9A, para 13.3</a>, where the financial remedy order was made on or after 22 April 2014, an application to set it aside under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>FPR 2010, SI 2010/2955, 9.9A</a> is to be made to the court that made that order. This reflects the departure from the previous conception of the application as being a species of appeal out of time. It is now clear that applications to set aside all or part of a financial remedy order, including a consent order, should be made to the first instance judge who made the order (if possible), or to a judge of the same level, rather than an appellate tribunal.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Barder</em> provides that a court may revisit a financial remedy order on the ground of new events if the conditions outlined by Lord Brandon (at p495) are satisfied, ie that the court may properly exercise its discretion on the basis of new events provided that:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a new event has occurred since the making of the order which invalidates the basis, or fundamental assumption on which the order was made</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the new event occurred within a relatively short time of the order having been made</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the application for leave to appeal out of time was made reasonably promptly in the circumstances of the case, and </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the grant of leave to appeal out of time (as was the appropriate remedy at that time) does not prejudice third parties who acquired, in good faith and for valuable consideration, interests in property which is the subject matter of the relevant order</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This four-limbed test in <em>Barder</em> was considered by Hale J (as she then was) in <em>Cornick v Cornick (No 1)</em>, in the context of a change in value of an asset since the date of the underlying order. Of the following three scenarios, only the third was found to potentially give rise to a <em>Barder</em> event:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>an asset which was taken into account and correctly valued at the date of the hearing changes value within a relatively short time owing to price fluctuation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a wrong value was put upon the asset at the hearing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>something unforeseen and unforeseeable has happened since the hearing which has altered the value of the assets so dramatically as to bring about a substantial change in the balance of the assets brought about by the order</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thorpe LJ observed in <em>Myerson v Myerson (No 2)</em> that ‘very few successful applications have been reported’. This accords with the common view that the gateway for a successful <em>Barder</em> application is narrow. This is unsurprising and perhaps appropriate given the public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation. <em>Myerson</em> was one of a number of cases in or around 2008-2009 where parties advanced the argument that the depreciation of their assets caused by the credit crunch and global financial crisis amounted to a <em>Barder</em> event, and therefore justified setting aside a financial order. In <em>Myerson</em>, the Court of Appeal rejected a <em>Barder</em> appeal brought by the husband where his shares in an alternative investment market (AIM) company fell dramatically from £2.99 per share when the order was made to £0.275 per share at the date of the Court of Appeal hearing. Dismissing the husband’s appeal, Thorpe LJ held that the test established in <em>Cornick</em> clearly pointed to the dismissal of the husband’s appeal, with words (at para [39]) that may seem as much of a warning now as they did in 2008-2009:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘There may be many who are contemplating an attempt to reopen an existing ancillary relief order on the grounds of subsequently encountered financial eclipse. All in that situation should ponder Hale J’s analytical characterisation and ask themselves whether the events upon which they intend to rely can be brought within either the second or the third category. Even then they would be well advised to heed the warning that very few successful applications have been reported. I echo the words of Hale J that the natural processes of price fluctuation, whether in houses, shares, or any other property, and however dramatic, do not satisfy the Barder test.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thorpe LJ also considered that other factors prevented the appeal from succeeding, notably that the husband had elected to carry risk in the hope of reward and that the remaining instalments of the lump sum were variable (at paras [33]-[36]).\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, an application in <em>Horne v Horne</em> was refused by the Court of Appeal, which found that the sharp fall in property valuations and the continued trading losses for the business in question had been foreseeable. Thorpe LJ stated (at para [14]):\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Looking at the authorities as a whole, given that Hale J’s judgment in Cornick has been consistently approved in later decisions, I can only conclude that the true path to be followed by trial judges is the path set by Barder followed by Cornick.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The inescapable conclusion is that the threshold is extremely high where the factual matrix concerns value fluctuations caused by market forces.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_833201'></mark>Is COVID-19 likely to be a Barder event?</h2>\n<p>There are likely to be many clients who now find themselves struggling to comply with one or more aspects of an order or are reflecting on what now feels like an unfair outcome.</p>\n<p>The most likely impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) seems set to be a significant shift in the value of assets or income. Minor or temporary fluctuations will clearly not be sufficient, nor will those that have occurred as a consequence of ‘normal’ price fluctuations. If there is a significant change, the issue will be whether the coronavirus (COVID-19) will be considered a sufficiently ‘abnormal’ or unforeseeable occurrence so as to lead to orders being set aside. Just as Thorpe LJ’s approach in <em>Myerson</em>, the starting point must be Hale J’s observation in <em>Cornick</em> (at p537) that ‘…once the couple are divorced and their capital divided, they cannot normally expect to profit from, any more than they should expect to lose by, later changes in the other’s fortune’.\n</p>\n<p>Given the courts’ response to <em>Barder</em> applications in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the question is whether there is likely to be any different response to similar changes brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19).\n</p>\n<p>While the consequences may be similar, it could be argued that the coronavirus (COVID-19) is in a different category and should be treated as a <em>Barder</em> event on the basis that this is not a foreseeable market disturbance. On the contrary, that these are wholly unforeseeable circumstances which have resulted in unprecedented UK government intervention in individual businesses and the economy more broadly, highlighting the uncomfortable friction between a government which recognises the exceptional nature of the pandemic by intervening directly in public finances at a universal grass-roots level and a hitherto hesitant judiciary which may refuse to accommodate requests to revisit orders made in circumstances which are now unrecognisable. On the other hand, the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis could be said to be just another event that has triggered a radical shift in the market, valuation, income, etc. It is currently unknown whether the courts will focus on cause or effect. Time will tell whether there will be a policy-level determination by an appeal court in the inevitable test case or if cases will be left to be determined on their individual facts and circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>Consider a long-established business that a trader has successfully run for many years, with no foreseeable threat to continued success. Potential issues to consider include whether the parties should have factored into their negotiations the emergence of a virus that would lead governments to rewrite the rulebook on state control, whether the outcome would be different if a party chose to take on the risk, no doubt in the hope of reward, and whether it would make a difference if dealing with a ‘sharing’ or a ‘needs’ case.</p>\n<p>An interesting granular level argument may be the date at which the current lockdown became foreseeable—arguably it took the government a long time to stop public events such as the Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff on the 15 March 2020. It may be argued that ‘public health advice’ allowed such events to ...</p></section></section></section></section></section>",

The package is intended to encourage banks to make full use of the flexibility embedded in the EU’s prudential and accounting framework so that banks can fully support citizens and companies during the pandemic by providing funding. Consisting of targeted ‘quick fix’ amendments to EU banking rules set out in the CRR, as well as an Interpretative Communication on the EU’s accounting and prudential frameworks, the package clarifies how the current rules can be applied more flexibly and in a coherent manner across the EU while ‘maintaining a prudent approach so as to preserve financial stability’.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the announcement of the proposed package, the European Commission’s executive vice-president for an economy that works for people, Valdis Dombrovskis, said ‘we are supporting households and businesses as much as we can to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus. The banking sector can do a lot to help here. We are using the full flexibility of the EU’s banking rules and proposing targeted legislative changes to enable banks to keep the liquidity taps turned on, so that households and companies can get the financing they need. I will soon also be launching roundtable discussions bringing together consumer and business groups with the financial sector so that we can address the most urgent needs of our citizens and companies.’</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_837791'></mark>The Amending Regulation</h2>\n<p>The European Commission set out its proposals in April 2020 in a <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>proposed Regulation amending the CRR and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (CRR II) as regards adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. In the explanatory memorandum to the Amending Regulation, the Commission explained that the severe economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the containment measures were having a far-reaching impact on the economy. While credit institutions are well capitalised and ‘much more resilient than they were in 2008’, enabling them to play a key role in managing the economic shock stemming from the pandemic, the Commission said that uncertainty related to the pace of economic activity would inevitably have an impact on the banking sector.</p>\n<p>In order to address the economic impact, in addition to highlighting the flexibility embedded in the existing prudential framework (please see <a href='#'>The Interpretative Communication</a> below), the Commission proposed making limited changes to specific aspects of the CRR to maximise credit institutions’ capacity to lend and to absorb losses related to the pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience. It also proposed changes to the existing rules in order to reflect changes agreed at an international level by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to delay by a year the implementation of the final elements of the Basel III framework and to allow greater flexibility to the phase-in of the impact of the International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) on capital.</p>\n<p>\n<a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Regulation (EU) 2020/873</a> (the Amending Regulation) was <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>published in the Official Journal of the EU</a> on 26 June 2020. It entered into force on 27 June 2020, and its provisions apply from that date (except for the amendments relating to the calculation of the leverage ratio, which apply from 28 June 2021). \n</p>\n<p>The main changes introduced by the Amending Regulation relate to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the non-performing loans (NPL) prudential backstop</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the date of application of the leverage ratio buffer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>offsetting the impact of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the date of application of the exemption of certain software assets from capital deductions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the date of application of the specific treatment envisaged for certain loans backed by pensions or salaries</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the date of application of the revised small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) supporting factor and the infrastructure supporting factor</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Transitional arrangements to mitigate IFRS 9 impact</h3>\n<p>IFRS 9 is an international accounting standard which sets out, among other things, how companies should value financial assets such as loans to households or companies, and how they should measure the risk associated with lending. It is particularly relevant to banks.</p>\n<p>Transitional arrangements under Article 473a of the CRR allow institutions to add back to their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital a portion of any increase in provisions due to the introduction of expected credit-loss (ECL) accounting under IFRS 9. The transitional arrangements consist of:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a static component, which allows credit institutions to partially neutralise the ‘day-one impact’ on CET1 capital of the increase in accounting provisions introduced by IFRS 9, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a dynamic component, which allows banks to partially neutralise the impact of the additional (post-day-one) increase in provisions for financial assets that are not credit-impaired</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The European Commission was concerned that the application of IFRS 9 during the coronavirus pandemic might lead to a sudden increase in the ECL provision of banks, which would result in an erosion of their capital and therefore their ability to continue lending at a time when businesses and households need it most. To mitigate the potential negative impact of this, the Amending Regulation extends the current transitional arrangements in the CRR.</p>\n<p>The existing transitional arrangements cover the period 2018–2022. The Amending Regulation extends that timeline by two years, effectively resetting the transition period so that financial institutions can add back to their CET1 capital during the period 2020–2024 any increase in new ECL provisions that they recognise in 2020 and 2021 for their financial assets which have not defaulted. Only provisions incurred as of 1 January 2020 are eligible, to ensure that the additional relief is related to the exceptional circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The transitional arrangements are extended for the dynamic component only, in accordance with the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>targeted revisions of the internationally agreed BCBS prudential standards</a>. The BCBS transitional arrangements for ECL accounting are set out at <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>CAP90.7</a> onwards in the Basel Framework.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Publicly guaranteed loans and the NPL prudential backstop</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although non-performing loan (NPL) stocks remain high in some EU Member States, significant progress has been made in recent years to address this, with banks strengthening confidence in their balance sheets, reducing the level of NPLs and improving operational efficiency. The NPL prudential backstop is a requirement for minimum loss coverage for NPLs, introduced into the CRR by <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Regulation (EU) 2019/630</a> to ensure that banks set aside sufficient funds to cover the risks associated with loans that have become non-performing. Under the backstop, NPLs guaranteed by official export credit agencies, which typically issue guarantees on behalf of national governments to provide credit protection for loans used for financing exports, are treated preferentially in respect of the provisioning requirements under Article 47c of the CRR. \n</p>\n<p>The Amending Regulation temporarily extends this preferential treatment to cover NPLs guaranteed by the public sector in the context of measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, in accordance with EU state aid rules. This temporary extension recognises the similar characteristics shared by export credit agencies guarantees and coronavirus-related guarantees.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Leverage ratio buffer—date of application</h3>\n<p>A new Article 92(1a) of the CRR, introduced by CRR II, imposes a leverage ratio buffer requirement on global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs). The date of application of the buffer was originally set to 1 January 2022 (see Article 3(5) of CRR II), but Article 2(2) of the Amending Regulation defers this date by one year, to 1 January 2023, to address the impact of the pandemic and to reflect the revised implementation timeline agreed by the BCBS.\n</p>\n<p>In its <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>questions and answers</a> on the Amending Regulation, the European Commission said it remained committed to implementing the final Basel III standards in the EU, and that it would use the additional time to take the impact of the pandemic on banks’ financial situation into account in preparing the impact assessment to accompany its forthcoming proposal on Basel III. </p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Calculating the leverage ratio</h3>\n<p>Banks built up excessive leverage during the years leading up to the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and were forced to reduce that leverage over a short period of time during the financial crisis due to losses and a shortage of funding. This amplified downward pressures on asset prices, causing further losses for banks and, in turn, further declines in their capital. Ultimately, this resulted in less availability of credit to the real economy and a deeper and longer crisis.</p>\n<p>To address this, the CRR introduced a new regulatory tool, the leverage ratio, which is a ratio between a bank’s capital and its exposures. Initially, banks were only required to calculate it, report it to their supervisors and disclose it publicly.</p>\n<p>CRR II modified the calculation of the leverage ratio, based on the revised Basel standard. The changes CRR II made included implementing a discretion (available under Article 429a(1)(n) and (5) to (7) of the amended CRR) to temporarily exclude central bank reserves from a bank’s leverage ratio calculation in exceptional circumstances. The exemption may be granted by competent authorities for a limited period of up to one year, and any impact of the exemption is fully offset via a mechanism (set out in Article 429a(7) of the CRR) that increases a bank’s individual leverage ratio requirement in a proportionate manner.\n</p>\n<p>The CRR, as amended by CRR II, provides that the discretion and the leverage ratio requirement will become applicable on 28 June 2021. However, the European Commission said the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic had shown that the offsetting mechanism (when applicable) would be too restrictive and its application would not actually facilitate an effective transmission of monetary policy (which the discretion is intended to do). Ultimately, the Commission felt the mechanism could force banks to deleverage by selling assets or reducing the level of lending to the economy. </p>\n<p>To address those concerns, the Amending Regulation modifies the offsetting mechanism to enhance the flexibility to act appropriately during possible future crises. A bank exercising the discretion would still need to calculate the so-called ‘adjusted leverage ratio’ but (unlike under the existing rule) that calculation would only need to take place once, at the moment it exercises the discretion. The adjusted leverage ratio would not change throughout the full period during which the discretion is exercised.\n</p>\n<p>The Amending Regulation also brings forward the application of several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure projects, and to invest in software.</p>\n<p>The amendments to Article 429a of the CRR apply from 28 June 2021.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Exemption of certain software assets from capital deductions—date of application</h3>\n<p>Intangible assets, including software, are generally required to be deducted from banks’ regulatory capital. CRR II changed the regulatory treatment of ‘prudently valued software assets’, which are not materially affected in a gone concern situation (ie the resolution, insolvency or liquidation of an institution), with the aim of supporting the transition towards a more digitalised banking sector. Under the amended rules, banks are no longer required to deduct these particular software assets from their CET1 capital (under Article 36(1)(b) of the CRR). The European Banking Authority (EBA) was mandated (under Article 36(4) of the CRR) to develop a draft RTS to specify how this exemption from deductions should be applied, by defining the scope of software assets to be exempted and how they will be risk-weighted. Under Article 3(7) of CRR II, the revised rules on the treatment of software assets are due to apply from 12 months after the RTS enters into force.\n</p>\n<p>However, in the context of the accelerated uptake of digital services as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Amending Regulation brings forward the date of application of the exemption and allows banks to use it as soon as the RTS enters into force.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Specific treatment for certain loans backed by pensions or salaries—date of application</h3>\n<p>CRR II introduced a more favourable treatment of certain loans granted by banks to pensioners or employees with a permanent contract. This favourable treatment was introduced due to the additional guarantees attached to such loans stemming from the unconditional transfer of part of the borrower’s pension or salary to that credit institution. The revision was due to become applicable on 28 June 2021.\n</p>\n<p>In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the Commission said the application of this revised treatment would incentivise banks to extend lending to employees and pensioners. On that basis, the Amending Regulation brings forward the date of application of the revised treatment, so that it applies from 27 June 2020.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>SME and infrastructure supporting factors—date of application</h3>\n<p>The ‘SME supporting factor’ is a capital reduction factor in the amount of capital that banks need to hold for prudential reasons in respect of loans they grant to SMEs. It was introduced by the CRR to allow banks to ensure an adequate flow of credit to SMEs. CRR II increased the capital discount for exposures to SMEs (the ‘revised SME supporting factor’), and introduced a new discount on the capital requirements for exposures to entities that operate or finance physical structures or facilities, systems and networks that provide or support essential public services (the ‘infrastructure supporting factor’). These revisions were due to apply from 28 June 2021.\n</p>\n<p>In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, there is an increased need for banks to continue lending to SMEs and supporting infrastructure investments. The supporting factors allow for a more favourable prudential treatment of certain exposures to SMEs and infrastructure with a view to incentivising banks to prudently increase lending to those entities. The Amending Regulation therefore advances the date of application of the two supporting factors, so that they apply from 27 June 2020.\n</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_837792'></mark>How did the legislative proposal develop?</h2>\n<table border='0' role='presentation'>\n<tbody xmlns:lnv='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lnv' xmlns:lnvxe='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lnvxe' xmlns:pgs='http://www.lexis-nexis.com/pgs'>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'><span class='boldtext'>Date</span></td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'><span class='boldtext'>Development</span></td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'><span class='boldtext'>Lexis®PSL Resources</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>28 April 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>The European Commission <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>adopted</a> its proposal for a banking package, consisting of the Amending Regulation and the Interpretative Communication, to facilitate lending to households and businesses in the EU during the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)–European Commission publishes banking package to facilitate lending, <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 28/04/2020 91</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>11 May 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>UK Finance published a <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>blog</a> suggesting some targeted modifications to the banking package proposed by the European Commission on 28 April 2020.</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—UK Finance suggests EU legislative modifications to enable banks to aim support at businesses and households affected by the pandemic, LNB News 11/05/2020 93</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>18 May 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>AFME published a <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>blog</a> by its head of prudential regulation, Michael Lever, which argued that the measures introduced at EU level (eg the targeted changes to the existing CRR and the changes made to ameliorate the capital impacts from IFRS 9) would not give banks enough capacity to provide the support to their customers that would be needed in the coming downturn and any subsequent recovery.</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—AFME queries whether European action taken is enough, <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 18/05/2020 71</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>18 May 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>The European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) considered the proposed Amending Regulation on 18 May 2020.</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—European Parliament to debate further bank lending, <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 18/05/2020 105</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>20 May 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>The European Parliament’s <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>procedural file</a> on adjustments in response to the coronavirus pandemic was updated on 20 May 2020 to indicate that it would examine the Amending Regulation at its plenary session on 18 June 2020.</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—European Parliament to consider adjustments to CRR in June plenary session, <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 20/05/2020 49</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='25%'>21 May 2020</td>\n<td align='left' char='x' charoff='y' valign='top' width='50%'>The ECB published an <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>opinion</a> supporting the proposed Amending Regulation.

Most business interruption cover requires that any such losses result from damage to insured property. There is, however, no standard form of business interruption insurance and some insurers offered policies with additional triggers for business interruption cover, such as denial of access or closure by a public authority.</p>\n<p>Many businesses have sought to claim under their business interruption insurance for coronavirus (COVID-19) losses but few have been indemnified. Aggrieved policyholders have been vocal and the mainstream press critical of the insurance industry’s response. Both have, however, brushed over the complex legal issues that have arisen in the context of coronavirus business interruption, which, unlike conventional perils such as fire or flood, cannot so easily be located at a particular place and time.</p>\n<p>Whether a policyholder is entitled to be indemnified for coronavirus business interruption is a matter of fact and policy construction, which are matters for the courts to determine, should the parties be unable to agree. In light of the need to urgently indemnify policyholders with valid claims and the need to protect the reputation of the insurance industry, the FCA, in consultation with policyholders and insurers, has commenced a test case under the <a href='#'>Financial markets test case scheme</a>. The test case is being expedited, with the purpose of providing clarity for policyholders and insurers, so that valid coronavirus business interruption claims can be settled as soon as possible. A hearing date has been set for 20 July 2020.</p>\n<p>This Practice Note provides information and guidance on coronavirus business interruption claims and the FCA test case in respect of ‘non-damage’ business interruption insurance cover. For information on coronavirus and insurance generally, see: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—insurance considerations</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_813268'></mark>Property and business interruption insurance</h2>\n<p>Property insurance for businesses often also provides business interruption insurance to cover insureds who have suffered property damage in respect of loss of profits or higher costs of working resulting from the damage to insured property and consequent repairs. This requires business interruption losses to flow from damage to insured property. It is, however, unlikely to respond to claims from businesses that have closed their doors due to the outbreak or staff shortages.</p>\n<p>This will be the standard position, whether the insured business was obliged to close down or whether it did so voluntarily. Accordingly, acutely affected businesses such as in the hospitality and leisure industry may be wholly <a href='#'>uninsured</a> in respect of the sudden and catastrophic downturn in business that followed the government’s social distancing advice, which explicitly included avoiding pubs and entertainment venues. <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Government measures</a> to assist affected businesses are likely only to partially mitigate the impact.\n</p>\n<p>There may be exceptional cases where, for example, contamination of premises with coronavirus might arguably constitute property damage. It is suggested, however, that such cases will be exceptional because the overwhelming majority of policyholders will lack any means to prove that their premises were in fact contaminated by coronavirus and that their losses were caused by such contamination, as opposed to government measures and advice to stay at home.</p>\n<p>That the UK government did not immediately impose widespread compulsory closures of business premises is unlikely to be relevant in the context of traditional damage based business interruption cover. While an official instruction to close could be considered a fortuity, businesses would still not be covered under standard property and business interruption insurance because of the absence of property damage.</p>\n<p>On 17 March 2020, the Prime Minister and Chancellor said that insurers will make payments to companies that are forced to close as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, if they have policies to that effect. They said an agreement has been reached with insurance companies to ensure businesses receive payouts where appropriate. While it may be expected that the government will encourage insurers to pay valid claims promptly and not to quibble in borderline cases, it is difficult to understand how insurers might be expected to pay claims that they did not insure—which is likely the position as regards holders of standard property damage and business interruption insurance.</p>\n<p>For a detailed chronology of the coronavirus pandemic, its impact on the UK, and steps taken by the government in response, see sections D and F of the FCA’s <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>amended particulars of claim</a> in the FCA business interruption insurance test case.</p>\n<p>Some policyholders may have paid additional premium for optional policy extensions to standard property and business interruption cover, which may include cover for losses arising out of a notifiable disease (declared by the UK government on 4 March 2020, see: <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 04/03/2020 30</a>). Such extensions may cover some policyholders’ loss of profit arising from the coronavirus outbreak but this will depend on the wording of the policy and the factual circumstances. Ultimately, coverage will depend on whether the outbreak and its consequences, in the absence of any property damage, is sufficient to trigger business interruption cover and whether any other policy terms apply. The extent to which ‘non-damage’ extensions will respond to coronavirus business interruption claims is expected to be clarified by the FCA test case.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_845897'></mark>Physical damage trigger</h2>\n<p>For policies that require physical damage to insured property in order to trigger business interruption cover, a key question is what constitutes ‘physical damage’ for the purposes of the relevant policy. In many cases ‘damage’ will be defined in the policy. In other cases, where damage is not defined, the question falls to be determined by reference to previous cases.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Blue Circle v Ministry of Defence</em> concerned a pond that had been contaminated by water containing radioactive material. The Court of Appeal held that this did constitute damage to the insured property (the land) on the basis that there was an alteration in its physical characteristics that rendered it less useful or valuable. This was because the radioactive material had intermingled with the land and could not be removed, short of excavating the contaminated soil.\n</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal in <em>Hunter v Canary Wharf</em> considered dust ingrained in carpet to be physical damage for similar reasons, ie that the insured property had been physically changed, rendering it less useful or valuable.\n</p>\n<p>In both <em>Blue Circle</em> and <em>Hunter</em> the relevant contaminant was intermingled with insured property, which was considered to be physical damage, but these cases may be distinguished from authorities dealing with surface contamination. In <em>Merlin v BNFL</em> radioactive dust that had contaminated only the surface of the insured property was held not to be physical damage. On the other hand, in <em>Losinjska Plovidba v Transco Overseas Ltd, The Orjula</em> [1995] 2 Lloyd&apos;s Rep 395 (not reported by LexisNexis®), the Commercial Court held that acid that had contaminated the deck of a vessel did constitute physical damage because the acid had to be removed by specialists.\n</p>\n<p>Coronavirus presents novel scenarios in this context in that it is understood to remain on surfaces for several days, following which the surface will no longer be contaminated. How the authorities fall to be applied may depend on the facts of each case but there are clearly tensions between them. These tensions will need to be resolved by the courts before policyholders and insurers have clarity as to whether and in what circumstances coronavirus contamination may constitute physical damage for the purposes of triggering business interruption insurance.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_845898'></mark>Contingent business interruption insurance</h2>\n<p>Businesses that are highly reliant on their suppliers may have insured against business interruption losses arising from damage or incapacity of its suppliers’ premises, ie contingent business interruption insurance. While these policies do not require any damage to the insured’s property the trigger for business interruption cover will usually require some tangible damage to the suppliers’ property. This is not always the case, however, and policyholders should look carefully at the triggers for business interruption cover. In some policies cover may be triggered by suppliers being denied access to premises, which may apply in places where governments have mandated premises to be closed. Accordingly, contingent business interruption policies may not provide cover for loss of profits unless the policy has been extended to cover losses from infectious diseases or is triggered by denial of access to premises (and not otherwise excluded).</p>\n<p>Those businesses which do have business interruption cover that responds to losses arising out of the coronavirus outbreak will also have to quantify their loss. This can be complex in ordinary circumstances but may be particularly so in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. This is because the insured business must show that its losses would not have occurred ‘but for’, or, arguably, largely because of, the insured against peril (such as denial of access) in circumstances where its takings would have been substantially reduced anyway for other reasons, such as its customers practicing social distancing. This type of argument was considered in <em>Orient-Express Hotels Ltd v Assicurazioni General SpA (UK) (t/a Generali Global Risk)</em>. See also News Analysis: and <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19) and insurance law implications</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Of the policies that are triggered by denial of access or infectious disease outbreak, many will impose a relatively low sub-limit for consequential business interruption losses, however policyholders would still need to establish causation. Coronavirus business interruption insurance causation issues are considered in News Analysis: <a href='#'>Proving causation—business interruption insurance coverage amid coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>\n<p>The Association of British Insurers believes only a small minority of businesses might have purchased an extension to their cover for closure due to infectious diseases (see: <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 17/03/2020 45</a>).</p>\n<p>Insurance products providing cover in the event of a pandemic (including parametric insurance) have been available for some years but the take up by businesses was scant.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_845899'></mark>Coronavirus business interruption litigation</h2>\n<p>On 22 May 2020, a House of Commons Briefing Paper was published, &apos;<a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Coronavirus: Business interruption insurance</a>&apos;. This set out demands for government action, the importance of policy wording and continuing disputes, potential legal action and the future.</p>\n<p>Policyholders in the UK have commenced legal action against certain insurers in order to pursue business interruption claims. Insurers that have sold policies with denial of access and infectious disease extensions are the primary targets. Hiscox in particular is the defendant in high profile group litigation that is being brought by several hundred policyholders, known as the Hiscox Action Group.</p>\n<p>Group actions are also being co-ordinated by industry sector. For example, the hospitality industry is coordinating a group action on behalf of its members (the Hospitality Insurance Group Action). Aviva Insurance and QBE UK have been identified as being the Hospitality Insurance Group Action’s focus. The Hiscox Action Group and the Hospitality Insurance Group are both represented by Mishcon de Reya LLP. Another group, led by the British Dental Association, has instructed Brown Rudnick LLP (see <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—dentists raise doubts over scope of FCA test case</a>).</p>\n<p>Mishcon de Reya announced on 15 June 2020 that it has also commenced arbitration against Hiscox in respect of its clients’ business interruption losses under policies that are subject to an arbitration clause (see: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—Mishcon launches arbitration claim against Hiscox</a>). The Hiscox Action Group and the Hospitality Insurance Group Action were both granted permission at the 26 June 2020 CMC to intervene and to make submissions in the FCA business interruption test case.</p>\n<p>Proceedings by policyholders and industry groups are also underway in other jurisdictions. In the US, various groups of claimants are seeking to consolidate proceedings against insurers in states that may favour policyholders’ interpretation of cover. These actions are taking place against a political and legislative backdrop which is hostile to insurers, with proposals including the imposition of retroactive business interruption cover for pandemics, even where the policy as issued does not provide such cover.</p>\n<p>Many US property insurers that are required to cover business interruption losses will have reinsured their property portfolio into the international reinsurance market. As with the direct policies, the affected reinsurance programmes impacted will not have been intended to cover loss of market resulting from the measures imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. It is nevertheless likely that there will be circumstances in which the property reinsurance market will be required to pay coronavirus business interruption losses. Reinsurance with broadly drafted reinsuring clauses and those with loss settlement clauses that preclude any reopening of the underlying facts will be impacted most.</p>\n<p>In other countries, including France and South Africa, some policyholders have succeeded in obtaining favourable court judgments in respect of their coronavirus business interruption insurance claims. These results arose, of course, in the context of different legal systems and on the basis of particular policy wordings and factual circumstances. It is nevertheless interesting to see how foreign courts, particularly common law influenced jurisdictions like South Africa, are dealing with some of the issues that are before High Court in the FCA test case. In <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Cafe Chameleon CC v Guardrisk Insurance Company Ltd</a>, the High Court of South Africa (Western Cape Division, Cape Town), the judge accepted that there was a clear nexus between the coronavirus outbreak and the government’s response to it, which caused the claimant’s loss. An argument that lockdown measures were only introduced to ‘flatten the curve’ was rejected.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_845900'></mark>The FCA test case on the validity of business interruption claims</h2>\n<p>Alongside the policyholder litigation, the FCA announced on 1 May 2020 that it intends to seek legal clarity on business interruption cover to resolve uncertainty as to whether or not policyholders are covered by their business interruption policies. The FCA is seeking to accomplish this by obtaining clarity from the courts in relation to particular key issues that are causing uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The FCA’s 1 May 2020 announcement expressly stated that the FCA’s intended action does not preclude individuals and qualifying companies from making a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). Indeed, a large volume of complaints to the FOS is anticipated. Whatever decision the court reaches in the FCA test case, it will be only be binding on the insurers that are party to it. The result should, however, provide persuasive guidance as to how the courts in other actions, and the FOS, should interpret particular policies, clauses and exclusions. It is unclear how the FOS will respond to business interruption insurance complaints in the meantime (see: <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 01/05/2020 35</a>).</p>\n<p>On 1 June 2020 the FCA published an <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>update on progress in the test case</a>. In its update, the FCA reported that it has reviewed over 500 policies from 40 insurers to identify a sample of policy wordings that is intended to be broadly representative of the different types of policies in the market that provide some form of business interruption cover. As of 1 June 2020, there were 17 policy wordings in the sample.</p>\n<p>The FCA also published an <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>initial list of insurers</a> and the policy wordings they use, together with specimen clauses from the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>representative sample of policy wordings</a> (see: <a href='#' title='References to'>LNB News 01/06/2020 64</a>).</p>\n<p>The FCA has also published <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>finalised guidance</a> for insurers and intermediaries dealing with coronavirus business interruption claims and complaints while the FCA test case is ongoing (see: <a href='#'>FCA finalised guidance on the COVID-19 business interruption insurance test case</a>).</p>\n<p>The first CMC in the FCA test case was heard before Justice Christopher Butcher on 16 June 2020, pursuant to which the judge ordered that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the case be allocated to the pilot Financial Markets Test Case Scheme (see <a href='#'>The Financial List—starting and transferring claims</a> for more information about the scheme)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the parties must apply for permission to rely on any factual or expert evidence by 24 June 2020</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a second CMC to be held on 26 June 2020</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the trial timetable will be expedited, with a...</p></li></ol></section></section></section></section></section>",

Thankfully, this crisis has been met by an explosion of innovation and new product development, supported by incredible generosity from pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are pooling their resources, making accessible their relevant intellectual property (IP) and supplying products for free or at cost. While the unprecedented sharing of IP is highly commendable to combat the pandemic, companies should be mindful of the manner in which their IP is protected and shared to avoid potentially adverse consequences to their IP rights and sustainable product development in the longer term.</p>\n<p>Companies will also need to be aware that some governments are considering extreme measures such as the use of compulsory licensing to allow third parties to use new technologies while avoiding patent infringement. This is concerning because the erosion of IP protection risks undermining future research and development (R&amp;D) since effective IP protection is essential to secure high-risk life sciences investment. Governments must therefore ensure that any extraordinary measures implemented in response to the pandemic do not compromise the development of future medical technologies.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_841600'></mark>Legal framework</h2>\n<p>Companies typically rely on patents for their core IP protection for medicines and medical devices. However, legislators have found patent protection to be insufficient to incentivise the development of medicines for unmet patient needs, necessitating the creation of additional regulatory IP rights. In the EU, these rights include supplementary protection certificates (to partially compensate patentees for the erosion of their patent protection due to the lengthy regulatory approval process), regulatory data protection and marketing protection (to protect the scientific data submitted with marketing authorisations for medicines and to support investments in medicines), orphan market exclusivity (to incentivise the development of drugs for rare diseases) and paediatric rewards (to stimulate and reward for conducting testing in the paediatric population). Medical devices cannot benefit from these regulatory IP rights, but they may additionally benefit from other forms of IP such as patent, copyright and design rights.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to patent protection have been built into legislative frameworks for use in cases of national emergency, such as the compulsory licensing of patents in certain circumstances or the ‘Crown use’ exception in the UK. Some countries, such as the UK, have introduced further protective measures for third parties that are looking to rely on coronavirus (COVID-19)-related IP, for example by indemnifying them against third-party claims for patent infringement should equipment made in response to the Ventilator Challenge infringe third-party IP rights.</p>\n<p>Faced with a significant global shortage of essential medicines, medical devices (in particular ventilators and incubators) and personal protective equipment, and the necessity to increase the production of those products exponentially, many life sciences companies are taking proactive measures to make their COVID-19-related IP available on a voluntary basis, mitigating against the need for governments to resort to exceptional measures to circumvent IP rights.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_841601'></mark>Voluntary licences</h2>\n<p>A number of pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies have already ‘donated’ IP by making the relevant information publicly available, or have offered voluntary licences, on a large scale. For example, Medtronic has publicly posted design specifications for its Puritan BennettTM560 (PB560) ventilator and Smiths Group has provided IP and advice in relation to its paraPAC Plus ventilator to the Ventilator Challenge UK.</p>\n<p>We have seen a number of different approaches taken by these companies, ranging from individual company initiatives, to the co-ordinated ‘pledging’ of IP and the creation of broad IP pools. In practice, measures have also included announcements that patentees will not enforce related patent rights and will make available clinical trial data through non-exclusive voluntary licences, appropriate waivers or similar mechanisms. For example, Novartis will make IP from its COVID-19 clinical trials available through non-exclusive voluntary licences/waivers etc and has published a set of compounds from its libraries that it considers suitable for in vitro antiviral testing. AbbVie has announced that it will not defend its patent rights to its drug Kaletra and Gilead Sciences has asked the Food and Drug Administration in the US to rescind the orphan drug designation awarded for its drug remdesivir for the COVID-19 indication.</p>\n<p>In some instances, time-limited licences have been granted which will be valid for a set period of years or until a specific event occurs such as the lifting of the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s public health emergency of international concern designation. Some licences have included terms requiring any subsequent modifications to the IP to also be made available under a licence on the same terms, so that new innovation continues to be passed forward.</p>\n<p>Companies have also been careful to ensure that trade marks are not infringed and that adequate warnings restricting the use of the product to the COVID-19 pandemic have been included.</p>\n<p>Innovators are also being encouraged to share their IP under the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Open Covid Pledge</a>, a scheme established by an international group of scientists and lawyers which provides a framework by which companies can freely licence their IP in order to support action against the pandemic. The pledgor will not assert any regulatory exclusivity against any entity for use of the licensed IP in accordance with the licence and will not seek injunctive or regulatory relief to prevent any entity from doing so.</p>\n<p>Licensing pools such as the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Medicines Patents Pool</a> (MPP) have existed for some time to support low- and middle-income countries. MPP has now expanded its mandate, in collaboration with Unitaid, to include medicines and diagnostics for COVID-19 in their licensing pools. In addition, the President of Costa Rica called on WHO to create a pool of rights to tests, medicines and vaccines for COVID-19, with free access or licensing on reasonable and affordable terms for all countries. WHO endorsed this proposal and, together with Costa Rica, has launched the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP)</a>.</p>\n<p>The MPP is already gathering patent knowledge for products being used in clinical trials and making it available on its patents and licences database, <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>MedsPaL</a>. Products already included in the database include: remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and two biologics: tocilizumab and sarilumab. In the UK, the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium</a> has been established to pool IP, technology, knowhow and resources to respond to shortages of ventilators.</p>\n<p>Further, many companies participating in the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator</a>, backed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, have agreed to share their proprietary libraries of molecular compounds that already have some degree of safety and activity data to quickly screen them for potential use against COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Industry participants who are generously sharing their IP should be mindful of the potential longer-term consequences to their IP after the crisis. For instance, future R&amp;D of antiviral medications for non-COVID-19 indications may be undermined if ...</p></section></section></section></section></section>",

This Act, which contains far-reaching reforms to UK insolvency law, mostly came into force on 26 June 2020 (subject to paragraph 51 of Schedule 3 coming into force on a day to be appointed). </p>\n<p>\n<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> is designed to help companies and other entities stay afloat where they find themselves in financial difficulties as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Among other things, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> includes the following provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>introduction of a company moratorium</span>—directors of insolvent companies or companies that are likely to become insolvent can obtain a 20 business day moratorium period to allow viable businesses time to restructure or seek new investment free from creditor action (ie to give the company some breathing space). The moratorium period may also be extended. The moratorium is overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a ‘monitor’ although the directors remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis (known as a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process with the company being the ‘debtor’). The moratorium is free-standing; it is not a gateway to a particular insolvency (or any process at all, if the company can be rescued during the moratorium without needing entry into an insolvency procedure)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>introduction of a restructuring plan</span>—the restructuring plan closely resembles the existing English ‘scheme of arrangement’ allowing a company to bind all creditors—including junior classes of creditors even if they vote against the plan—through the use of a ‘cross-class cram down’ provision. Such cram down could be imposed provided dissenting classes of creditors are no worse off than they would be in the relevant alternative. The classes of creditors would be proposed by the distressed company on a case-by-case basis. For a class to vote in favour, 75% of a class by value has to agree to the plan. No financial conditions are set in order to qualify for a restructuring plan. This means both solvent and insolvent companies will be able to propose restructuring plans to their creditors\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>temporary restrictions on winding-up petitions</span>—the government has legislated to temporarily prevent winding up proceedings being taken on the basis of unsatisfied statutory demands and to temporarily stop winding up proceedings where coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company which has caused the grounds for the proceedings. The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> provides that a winding-up petition based on section 123(1)(a) of the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Insolvency Act 1986</a> (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986</a>) (ie an unsatisfied statutory demand in respect of a debt exceeding £750) that relates to a statutory demand served on or after 1 March 2020 cannot be presented by a creditor during the period beginning on 27 April 2020 (it has retrospective effect) until 30 September 2020. More widely, a petition may not be presented unless the creditor has reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the debtor, or (b) the debtor would have been unable to pay its debts even if coronavirus had not had a financial effect on the debtor. The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> makes provision where a winding-up order has been made during the relevant period\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, see: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—overview</a> (subscription dependent).</p>\n<p>Defined benefit (DB) schemes are unsecured creditors which means that they usually rank at the bottom of the priority order on an employer insolvency, unless they benefit from a contingent asset with a higher priority. In turn, this means they rarely get their deficit paid in full, so that they often end up entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF).</p>\n<p>While the measures of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> are welcome for struggling employers, they potentially limit the options trustees of DB schemes can pursue in the short term to secure the monies owed to them. At the same time, enabling the sponsoring employer to stay afloat will usually be beneficial to the scheme in the long term.</p>\n<p>If they haven’t already done so, trustees of DB schemes should review the impact of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> on the employer covenant, the amount they might be able to recover from the employer in the event of an employer insolvency, as well as any contingent asset the scheme might be entitled to.</p>\n<p>The changes made by <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> are also relevant to any trustee decision concerning a request by an employer to suspend or reduce deficit repair contributions (DRCs)—for more information on such requests, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—the pensions implications for employers—Suspending or reducing deficit repair contributions (DRCs) and future service costs</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_846964'></mark>The moratorium—pensions issues</h2>\n<p>While a moratorium is in place, a struggling employer will effectively benefit from a payment holiday in respect of certain ‘pre-moratorium’ pension debts (ie pension debts which fell/fall due before or during the moratorium). \n</p>\n<p>Key points and concerns relating to the moratorium provisions of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the moratorium will not provide a payment holiday for debts in respect of ‘wages or salary arising under a contract of employment’. ‘Wages or salary’ is defined as including ‘a contribution to an occupational pension scheme’. This means that the moratorium provisions CIGA 2000 will not affect debts in respect of contributions arising under a contract of employment. It seems that contractually agreed DC contributions and DB contributions for future service can be said to be contributions arising under a contract of employment, so that such contributions should continue to remain due during a moratorium provided the scheme is an occupational pension scheme. The Pensions Regulator has certainly taken the view that ‘all contributions due in respect of the company’s employees who are members of any occupational pension scheme must still be made during a moratorium’, but it has not made it clear whether it believes that such contributions include DCRs—see third bullet point below for more information on DRCs\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>DC contributions to a personal pension scheme could also be said to be contributions under a contract of employment, but contributions to a personal pension scheme do not fall within the definition of ‘wages or salary arising under a contract of employment’. While this may simply be an omission, it leaves us in a position where contributions to a personal pension scheme will be treated as a ‘pre-moratorium debt’ for which the employer will have a payment holiday during a moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in the context of a DB scheme, it is unlikely that DRCs can be said to be contributions which arise ‘under a contract of employment’. It seems more accurate to say that DRCs arise under a DB scheme’s schedule of contributions or recovery plan. It therefore seems that, while a moratorium is in place, a payment holiday will be granted to the employer in respect of the following pre-moratorium pension debts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>outstanding DRCs (although the trustees may have agreed, in any event, to suspend such DRCs temporarily as a result of the coronavirus pandemic—see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—the pensions implications for employers—Suspending or reducing deficit repair contributions (DRCs) and future service costs</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>section 75 debts triggered before or during the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>potentially, pension scheme expenses payable by the employer (since contributions covering scheme expenses cannot be said to arise under a contract of employment)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>contribution notices and financial support directions due to the Pensions Regulator. Indeed, CIGA’s definition of ‘pre-moratorium debt’ reflects the case <em>Re Nortel GmbH (in administration)</em> by making a distinction between provable debts and expenses in administration. Following the Supreme Court’s reasoning, liabilities such as contribution notices and financial support directions under the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Pensions Act 2004</a> should be considered pre-moratorium debts (and, therefore, not payable during the moratorium) even if the request to pay them arises after the start of the moratorium. For more information on <em>Re Nortel GmbH (in administration)</em>, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>FSD not above claims of other creditors for administration (Re Nortel GMBH)</a>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>as the moratorium prevents legal action against the employer, including by commencing a claim or crystallising a floating charge, DB trustees may find it difficult to enforce a contingent asset while a moratorium is in place\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a moratorium could be extended by up to 12 months, which means that DB schemes could be left: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>without DRC payments or scheme expenses for up to a year. This may force DB trustees to divest some of the scheme’s less liquid assets to ensure they can meet cash flow requirements. If a moratorium is extended, a review of the scheme’s investment strategy and statement of investment principles may be in order, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>unable to recover existing pension debts or enforce any contingent asset for up to a year. Again, this may put the scheme in a precarious position if the moratorium leads to an employer insolvency, as the moratorium will have left the trustees unable to reduce the size of the pension debt before the employer enters insolvency</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>\n<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> contains a power to make regulations amending the types of debts for which there will be no payment holiday during a moratorium.

This allows planning committee and other important council meetings to continue remotely and be remotely attended by members of local authorities, the public and the press. The regulations also enable English local authorities to hold and alter the frequency and occurrence of meetings without requirement for further notice. Existing legislative requirements for English local authority meetings are also disapplied.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Guidance</a> published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government (MHCLG) on 13 May 2020 (the 13 May MHCLG Guidance) urges English LPAs to take advantage of these powers to hold virtual planning committees—rather than deferring committee dates—and also consider using ‘urgency powers’ within their constitutions to give senior officers delegated authority to make decisions. MHCLG is working with the Planning Advisory Service to provide practical advice to LPAs through on-line <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>guidance</a> and web-based training on how to manage planning committees and continue decision-making.\n</p>\n<p>In Wales, the Local Authorities (Coronavirus) (Meetings) (Wales) Regulations 2020, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2020/442</a> enable Welsh LPAs’ meetings to be held remotely up to 1 May 2021 and for their frequency and occurrence to be altered.</p>\n<p>On 24 March 2020, the Chief Planner, Steve Quartermain, <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>wrote to chief planning officers</a> of LPAs in England, providing information on the coronavirus position (the Chief Planner’s letter). \n</p>\n<p>In respect of decision-making, the Chief Planner’s letter stresses the need for LPAs to continue to process planning application and provide the best service possible, especially where the decisions will support the local economy. It encourages LPAs to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>be pragmatic and continue, as much as possible, to work proactively with applicants and others, where necessary agreeing extended periods for making decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>take an innovative approach, recognising that, while face-to-face events and meetings may have to be cancelled, technology should be used where possible to ensure that discussions and consultations can go ahead</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>consider delegating committee decisions where appropriate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>prioritise permitted development prior approval applications where possible and if necessary, seek to agree an extended approval date with the applicant. Where agreement cannot be reached, the LPA may need to consider whether prior approval should be refused if the application cannot be considered with the requisite attention</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Much of this has been overtaken by the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>13 May MHCLG Guidance</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Validation of applications</h3>\n<p>The <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>13 May MHCLG Guidance</a> advises English LPAs to encourage all planning applications to be made online to avoid the need for staff to work in the office. This should continue to enable the remote processing of planning applications to continue as far as possible to support the latest social distancing guidelines. LPAs should make this clear on their websites and contact local agents to inform them that applications should be submitted online. However, the guidance emphasises that arrangements are in place to ensure paper applications can still be validated. Priority should continue to be given to the validation of any urgent coronavirus-related applications for planning permission and associated consents, including hazardous substance consents, where statutory consultees if necessary, should be contacted immediately.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Publicity and consultation for planning applications</h3>\n<p>On 14 May 2020, the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure, Listed Buildings and Environmental Impact Assessment) (England) (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2020/505</a> (the 2020 Regulations) came into force. The 2020 Regulations, expiring on 31 December 2020, supplement the existing statutory publicity arrangements in England for planning applications, listed building consent applications and environmental statements for environment impact assessment (EIA) development in response to coronavirus. They amend, on a temporary basis, certain requirements placed on LPAs and applicants for development requiring an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for publicity and inspection of documents where the authority or applicant is not able to comply with a particular requirement because it is not reasonably practicable to do so for reasons connected to the effects of coronavirus, including restrictions on movement.</p>\n<p>Under the 2020 Regulations, LPAs (and applicants of EIA development under the TCPA) in England have the flexibility to take other reasonable steps to publicise applications if they cannot discharge the specific requirements for site notices, neighbour notifications or newspaper publicity because of the impacts of coronavirus. The LPA, or in the case of EIA development, the applicant, must take reasonable steps to communicate the notice to people who are likely to have an interest in a planning application/listed building application/EIA development, including people who live or work in, or otherwise have a direct connection with, the area in which the proposed development is located. The reasonable steps that an LPA/applicant must take may include use of social media and communication by other electronic means, and must be proportionate to the scale and impact of the development. The requirement for physical inspection of documents is disapplied where LPAs can no longer do so safely, and instead, documents need to be made available online. In respect of EIA development, the requirement to ensure copies of an environmental statements at a named address is removed, and instead, an applicant must by electronic notice publicise where the environmental statement is available online. The minimum consultation period, during which members of the public can submit representations in respect of a planning applications, is also extended from 14 to 21 days.</p>\n<p>Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) has been updated to provide a summary of the changes introduced by the 2020 Regulations. It provides guidance on how LPAs and applicants can comply with the 2020 Regulations and best publicise planning applications where it is not possible to comply with requirements for site notices, neighbour notifications, newspaper publicity or physical inspection of documents. Specifically, it provides guidance on: what forms of electronic communication might be appropriate, what LPAs can do to make their online planning register more accessible (in the absence of putting planning documentation out for physical inspection), how an LPA should determine which people have to be notified electronically and what issues an LPA should consider in ensuring the reasonable steps they take are proportionate to the scale and impact of the development.\n</p>\n<p>For more detail, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Planning publicity and consultation in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Determination timescales</h3>\n<p>The <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>13 May MHCLG Guidance</a> also clarified that the government in England does not intend to change the determination timescales for planning applications set out in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>SI 2015/595</a>, but acknowledged that timescales may not be met in all cases.

In addition to a pavement licence, some LPAs require the business to also apply for planning permission on the basis that putting tables and chairs on the highway is a change of use of the land. The Bill provides that where a temporary pavement licence is granted, any necessary planning permission is automatically deemed to have been granted. This is a bespoke procedure, outside of the existing procedures under the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Highways Act 1980</a> and other local acts such as the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>London Local Authorities Act 1990</a>.</p>\n<p>For more detail, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Planning reforms for England in the Business and Planning Bill 2019–21</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_837711'></mark>Planning conditions and enforcement</h2>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Delivery hours of supermarkets in England</h3>\n<p>On 13 March 2020, the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick published a <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Written Ministerial Statement</a> on the ‘urgent matter’ of enabling retailers of food, sanitary and other essential items to increase the frequency of deliveries to their stores to support the response to the coronavirus outbreak in England.\n</p>\n<p>Currently, many supermarkets, food retailers and distribution centres in England are subject to planning conditions, which restrict the time and number of deliveries from lorries and other delivery vehicles, particularly at night.

On 20 March 2020, the government announced that businesses including restaurants, pubs and leisure centres must close, and on 23 March 2020 a full lockdown was introduced, sending huge parts of the private sector into hibernation. As lockdown is eased and replaced by social distancing measures, many businesses continue to face financial pressures and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate the economic consequences and keep the economy on life support, the government has already introduced a range of measures, from financial support initiatives to legislative reform. For further details of the financial support available, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19)—summary of government support</a>.</p>\n<p>Directors of companies in financial difficulties are presented with many practical and legal concerns, including the risk of personal liability. One of the key concerns for directors is usually the threat of liability for wrongful trading under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>section 246ZB</a> of the Insolvency Act 1986 (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986</a>) (in the context of insolvent administration) and <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s 214</a> (in the context of insolvent liquidation). While there is no offence of trading while insolvent under English law, directors and shadow directors of a company that goes into insolvent administration or insolvent liquidation can be liable to make a personal contribution to the company’s assets where wrongful trading has occurred.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_841234'></mark>The wrongful trading regime</h2>\n<p>Essentially a wrongful trading claim arises where:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>at some time before the commencement of the company’s administration or liquidation, the director knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>from that point, the director failed to take every step with a view to minimising the further potential loss to the company’s assets/creditors</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a director is found liable, they can be ordered to make a contribution which generally reflects the increase in the company’s net deficiencies (ie losses to creditors as a whole) that the company incurred during the period of wrongful trading (ie from the point at which the directors concluded or ought to have concluded there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent administration or liquidation to the point of the actual insolvency). This is subject to the statutory defence of taking every step with a view to minimising losses. For further reading on the wrongful trading regime, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Wrongful trading claims under sections 214 and 246ZB of the Insolvency Act 1986</a>.\n</p>\n<p>There is no requirement to show that the company actually traded during this period (provided that losses are increasing), nor is the word ‘trading’ referred to in the wording of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, ss 214</a> nor 246ZB. Therefore, one of the immediate consequences of coronavirus was that directors could be liable for wrongful trading even though they were not in fact able to trade.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_841235'></mark>The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020</h2>\n<p>In a bid to prevent directors commencing insolvency proceedings prematurely in order to avoid personal liability, the government announced its intention to legislate to temporarily suspend the wrongful trading regime, with such suspension being back-dated to 1 March 2020.</p>\n<p>On 20 May 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill was introduced, which makes a number of far-reaching changes to UK insolvency law, some permanent and some temporary (see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill</a>). Unlike the temporary changes to the wrongful trading regime, many of the changes are based on the 2016 Insolvency and Corporate Governance consultation, which the government responded to in August 2018 (see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Exploring the government’s response to the insolvency and corporate governance consultation</a>). However, in the end the proposed changes to the wrongful trading regime are more nuanced than the original announcement may have led many practitioners to anticipate.</p>\n<p>The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020</a> (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a>) received Royal Assent on 25 June 2020. For further information on the Act, see: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill—overview</a>.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_841236'></mark>What are the proposed changes?</h2>\n<p>\n<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020, s 12</a> is headed ‘suspension of liability for wrongful trading’, but the section itself does not suspend the wrongful trading regime. Instead, it provides that in determining for the purposes of wrongful trading (whether under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, ss 214</a> or <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>246ZB</a>) the contribution (if any) that a person should make to a company’s assets, the court is to assume that the person is not responsible for any worsening of the financial position of the company or its creditors that occurs during the ‘relevant period’. This period runs from 1 March 2020 (therefore providing retrospective effect, as promised) to 30 September 2020 (although the draft legislation as introduced provided for a long stop ...</p></section></section></section></section></section>",

The moratorium is overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a ‘monitor’, although the directors will remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis (known as a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process with the company being the ‘debtor’) subject to certain constraints. The intention is to provide a streamlined procedure that keeps administrative burdens to a minimum, makes the process as quick as possible and does not add disproportionate costs on to struggling businesses.</p>\n<p>The moratorium will be free-standing—it is not be a gateway to a particular insolvency (or any process at all, if the company can be rescued during the moratorium without needing entry into an insolvency procedure).</p>\n<p>This Practice Note considers how the moratorium may be commenced, what action may be taken during the moratorium and potential areas of difficulties. For information on how to extend, terminate and challenge the moratorium, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill 2020—moratorium extension and termination</a>.</p>\n<p>For links to forms to be used in connection with the commencement, extension and termination of the moratorium, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—moratorium forms</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_836528'></mark>Who is eligible to apply?</h2>\n<p>The company needs to meet the following criteria::</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>it is likely that the moratorium would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, Sch</a> ZA1 excludes certain companies from using the moratorium.

Each statement under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s A6(1)(b) to (e)</a> must be made within the period of 5 days ending with the day on which the documents under A6(1)(a) to (e) are filed/lodged with the court (or, if the documents are filed on different days, the last of those days). Where documents are filed on different days, the moratorium comes into force on the last of those days.\n</p>\n<p>Where directors of a company file relevant documents with the court by means of electronic delivery (within the meaning of <a href='#'>CPR PD 51O</a>) for the purposes of obtaining a moratorium, the documents shall be treated as being filed with the court at the date and time recorded in the email referred to at <a href='#'>CPR PD 51O, para 5.3(1)</a>, generated by automatic notification acknowledging that the documents have been submitted.\n</p>\n<p>As a temporary measure, until 30 September 2020, the monitor is able to qualify their statement such that the moratorium would be likely to result in the company being rescued as a going concern or would do so if it were not for any worsening of the financial position due to coronavirus.\n</p>\n<p>As drafted, it is not clear whether the monitor must believe that the company can be rescued as a going concern within the initial period, or can assume that it is reasonably likely to be possible to obtain a suitable extension if required. Turning a company around in 20 business days (or 40 business days if the monitor was to assume the first extension by the directors) will be a big ask in many restructurings.</p>\n<p>Where the company is a regulated company within the meaning of <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s A48(13)</a>, written consent of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to the appointment of the proposed monitor must be included with the filing or application.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_836530'></mark>During the moratorium</h2>\n<p>During the moratorium the company must continue to pay on-going costs of running the business (defined as moratorium debts). In addition, the company must meet the following pre-moratorium debts which do not benefit from a payment holiday during the moratorium:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the monitor’s remuneration and expenses</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>goods/services supplied during the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>rent in respect of a period during the moratorium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>wages or salary arising under a contract of employment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>redundancy payments, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>debts or other liabilities arising under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (as defined in new <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, Sch</a> ZA2)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The moratorium that arises is very similar to the moratorium that arises in an administration under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, Sch B1</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no insolvency proceedings may be commenced, other than on an application by the directors or on public interest grounds \n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no steps may be taken without the permission of the court in relation to forfeiture, enforcement of security (other than in relation to financial collateral), repossessing goods under a hire purchase agreement or instituting/continuing any legal process (other than employment-related claims) \n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unlike an administration, where the administrator may consent to the lifting of the stay, the restriction on enforcement and legal proceedings in the moratorium may only be lifted by the court—neither the directors nor the monitor has that power. Additionally, a creditor with a pre-moratorium debt that is subject to a payment holiday during the moratorium may not apply to court for permission to enforce that debt. By contrast, a creditor with a pre-moratorium debt which is not subject to a payment holiday (for example, a lender) can apply to court for permission to enforce the debt by way of security enforcement or otherwise. \n</p>\n<p>The moratorium does not, however, prevent a creditor from declaring a default or exercising its right to accelerate a debt or terminate the contract\n</p>\n<p>Floating charges cannot be crystallised, nor can new restrictions be placed on disposal of the chargor’s property during the moratorium. Though it is not specifically stated, the types of new restrictions which are prohibited might include those contained in notices to contract counterparties (or banks where the company holds accounts) requiring the counterparty to deal only with the lender from the date of the notice. This means that the company is likely to be able to deal with floating charge assets in the ordinary course of its business during the moratorium without the lender being able to exert any additional control and without any requirement that the sale proceeds be applied in reduction of the related debt.\n</p>\n<p>The directors of the company remain in control of the company during the moratorium but are subject to certain restrictions designed to protect creditors. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no credit may be obtained in excess of £500 unless the lender has been informed that there is a moratorium is in force \n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>security can only be granted if the monitor consents on the basis that the grant of security will support the rescue of the company as a going concern \n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a prohibition on entry into certain financial instruments \n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>no payment of pre-moratorium debts in excess of the greater of £5000 or 1% of total indebtedness unless the monitor agrees. The monitor can only consent on the basis that they think it will support the rescue of the company as a going concern\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>restrictions on the disposal of prope...</p></li></ol></section></section></section></section></section>",

The government previously consulted on proposed changes to the UK’s insolvency regime and published its response on 26 August 2018 (see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Exploring the government’s response to the insolvency and corporate governance consultation</a>). The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> largely follows the conclusions set out in the government’s response.Among the reforms, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020, s 7</a> and <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Sch 9</a> introduce a new <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Part 26A</a> of the Companies Act 2006 (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CA 2006</a>)—Arrangements and Reconstructions for Companies in Financial Difficulty (a ‘restructuring plan’) which is also supported by the <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Practice Statement (Companies: Schemes of Arrangement under Part 26 and Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006)(Practice Statement 2020)</a>.\n</p>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_843552'></mark>What are the practical implications?</h2>\n<p>We have already seen several corporate failures around the world linked to coronavirus. Some of the reforms implemented by the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> have been in the pipeline for several years, including the new tool for struggling companies—a restructuring plan. The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> restructuring plan should give many struggling companies which have viable underlying businesses the tools needed and necessary breathing space to secure a rescue.</p>\n<p>The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> introduces a new restructuring procedure that allows a company to bind all creditors, including junior (or senior) classes of creditors even if they vote against the plan, through the use of a cross-class cram down (CCCD) provision. Such cram down can be imposed provided dissenting classes of creditors are no worse off than they would be in the relevant alternative. The classes of creditors will be proposed by the distressed company on a case by case basis. For a class to vote in favour, 75% of a class by value must agree to the plan. The restructuring plan provisions are a permanent change to the UK’s insolvency laws and a welcome addition to its toolkit.</p>\n<p>The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a>’s separate moratorium proposals also mean that a statutory moratorium is available, subject to eligibility, to protect a company while it prepares its proposal. </p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_843553'></mark>Eligibility criteria</h2>\n<p>The availability of a restructuring plan is not dependent on the company’s size or turnover; this is in line with <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>the government’s response in August 2018 to the Insolvency and Corporate Governance consultation</a> that the restructuring plan should be available to all companies as there may be circumstances where a smaller company may better effect a rescue via a restructuring plan than by using a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) (ie despite the fact that some respondents had argued that in practice only larger more complex companies would be viable given the costs associated with two court hearings). However:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>the Secretary of State may introduce regulations to exclude certain companies which are authorised persons (‘authorised person’ has the same meaning as in the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>—ie those involved in specific financial market transactions; this is to avoid interfering with the proper functioning and integrity of those markets)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the earlier wording excluding the binding effect on creditors with aircraft-related interests (see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill—Restructuring Plan provisions</a>) was removed from the draft Bill before it was presented to the House of Lords. This is a welcome change as otherwise the restructuring plan could not have been used effectively for airline failures.</p>\n<p>The <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Insolvency Service factsheet</a> accompanying the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> states that regulations are expected to extend the provisions to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>charitable incorporated organisations (CIOs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>mutuals (including co-operatives and community benefit societies)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>limited liability partnerships (LLPs)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Conditions A and B must be met (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CA 2006, s 901A</a>):\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>Condition A is that the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern (no further guidance is provided on the meaning or scope of the term ‘financial difficulties’, which is potentially very broad).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>Condition B is that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>(a) a compromise or arrangement (arrangement includes a re-organisation of the company’s share capital by the consolidation of shares of different classes or by the division of shares into shares of different classes, or by both of those methods) is proposed between the company and (i) its creditors, or any class of them, or (ii) its members, or any class of them, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>(b) the purpose of the compromise or arrangement is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of the financial difficulties mentioned</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Solvent or insolvent</span>—no hard financial conditions are set in order to qualify for a restructuring plan (beyond that the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern mentioned in Condition A above). This means both solvent and insolvent companies may propose restructuring plans to their creditors/members.</p>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Available to insolvency practitioners (IPs)</span>—a company in an insolvency procedure, acting through the insolvency office-holder (eg an administrator or liquidator), may also propose a restructuring plan to creditors/members. While the government does not think this would happen often, maximum flexibility is desirable to ensure viable businesses do not fail unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Compromise or arrangement</span>— query the extent to which there must be an exchange for value ie whether the plan proponent can completely disenfranchise a certain class of creditors/members even if they are out of the money without offering them something in return of at least a nominal value.</p>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Application available to debtor or creditors or members</span>—the debtor itself may apply (as will usually be the case) or the creditors (this is a change from <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>the government’s response 2018 </a> which envisaged that only the debtor could apply) or the members. In practice, query whether creditors or members will have the requisite information required to file an application for a restructuring plan.</p>\n<p>\n<span class='boldtext'>Jurisdiction</span>—applies to companies liable to be wound up under the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Insolvency Act 1986</a> (<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986</a>) (new <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CA 2006, s 901</a> A(4)(b)); this is a similar definition to that used for schemes of arrangement, which use the broader test of whether or not a company has sufficient connection with the relevant court of the UK (for the approach used in schemes, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Establishing jurisdiction and sufficient connection for schemes of arrangement</a>) rather than the higher centre of main interests (COMI) test (see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Recast Regulation—establishing the centre of main interests (COMI) for corporates</a>). Therefore, a company incorporated outside of the UK may be eligible if it has a sufficient connection with the UK (and fulfils the other tests listed above). This makes the restructuring plan a formidable tool for international restructuring.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_843554'></mark>Excluded creditors </h2>\n<p>An important limitation on the effect of the restructuring plan is that relevant creditors for moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts have the ability to veto a subsequent restructuring plan that proposes to compromise them where commenced within 12 weeks of the end of a moratorium (see  new <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CA 2006, ss 901H</a> and <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>899A</a> ). Note, that each of these creditors has a right of veto. The final wording here (made after receipt of proposals by the City of London Law Society (CLLS)) amends <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>s 174A</a> IA 1986 to clarify the order of priority of moratorium debts and excludes ‘relevant accelerated debt’, being any pre-moratorium debt that fell due during the relevant period by reason of the operation of, or the exercise of rights under, an acceleration or early termination clause in a contract or other instrument involving financial services.\n</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that in order to implement a successful wholesale restructuring of all creditor types, the restructuring plan must be launched (i) whilst any moratorium is in force (ie before it ends) or (ii) without the use of any prior moratorium or (iii) with the consent of these excluded creditors.</p>\n<p>For more detailed consideration of the impact on lenders, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 and other developments in insolvency and restructuring—key issues and discussion points for lenders</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_843555'></mark>Process</h2>\n<p>Consultation responses and discussions with stakeholders persuaded the government of the benefits of modelling the restructuring plan procedure on that of schemes of arrangements. As well as familiarity, this has the advantage of providing a long-established and tested body of jurisprudence that courts will be able to draw upon when dealing with the new restructuring plan and considering matters such as class formation (ie relevant scheme case law should be applicable to relevant provisions of the new restructuring plan procedure, see: <a href='#'>Schemes of arrangement—overview</a>). In practice, lock up agreements are also likely to be used to bind creditors/members into voting in favour of the restructuring plan. Note that the new <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Practice Statement 2020 </a>must also be complied with.</p>\n<p>The new process therefore largely mirrors that used in schemes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a restructuring plan proposal will be sent to creditors/members and filed at court</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>at a first hearing, the court will examine the classes of creditors/members as defined by the applicant (this is akin to a scheme convening hearing; see Practice Note <a href='#'>Schemes of arrangement—convening hearing and sanction hearing</a>). Creditors/members may challenge class formation if they think the company’s classes do not accurately reflect the rights and interests of different classes. Note that although there is no specific guidance in the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> on how classes are formed, the expectation is that courts will follow the existing scheme caselaw on this ie stakeholders should vote in the same class where their rights are ‘not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest’ (see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Schemes of arrangement—class issues</a> and checklist: <a href='#'>Checklist of factors which may (and may not) fracture the class in a scheme of arrangement</a>). <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Practice Statement 2020</a>, para 2 emphasises that it is the responsibility of the applicant to (i) determine whether more that one meeting of creditors and/or members is required and (ii) if so, to ensure those meetings are properly constituted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if satisfied, the court will confirm that a vote on the proposal may be conducted on a specified date ahead of a second hearing if required</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>necessary information would be anything that creditors/members need in order to make a decision whether or not to support the proposal (ie similar to the explanatory statement used in schemes; also see <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>Practice Statement 2020</a>), including certain mandatory matters that must be covered in all cases (see further below)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>vote of creditors (or members)—if no challenges are brought or no counter-proposals permitted by the court then creditors/members will vote on the proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>court sanction hearing—subject to the requisite voting thresholds being met and the rules for imposing a cross-class cram down being complied with (discussed below), the court will then schedule a second hearing at which it will consider if the necessary requirements have been met and will make a decision whether or not to confirm the restructuring plan and make it binding on affected creditors/members</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the appointment of a supervisor is not mandatory (although this was mooted in the earlier consultations), but parties are free to engage a supervisor if they wish.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_847696'></mark>Pension schemes</h2>\n<p>Following significant lobbying from various pensions groups, the Pensions Regulator/Pension Protection Fund (PPF) now have a seat at the negotiating table in certain cases and are entitled to the notices which creditors/members receive.

Creditors can do this if the contract contains a provision entitling the creditor to terminate on the grounds of insolvency or the impaired financial position of the counterparty. These types of clauses are known as ipso facto clauses.</p>\n<p>Typically, the creditor will refuse to continue supplying the insolvent company unless it agrees to settle any outstanding debts it owes to the creditor. This creates a problem for the company because it can divert limited funds away from keeping the business afloat. It also risks disturbing the statutory waterfall of payments on insolvency—see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Waterfall of payments—a comparative guide</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_836871'></mark>What was the position prior to the CIGA 2020?</h2>\n<p>One of the long-standing principles of English law is the freedom of parties to contract as they choose. However, the law has long recognised the need to impose certain restrictions and safeguards on that freedom, for example to prevent duress. When a company enters an insolvency process, the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986</a> already prevents suppliers of ‘essential supplies’ from demanding payment of pre-insolvency debts as a condition of continuing the supply (see <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s 233</a>). Where the company enters into administration or a voluntary arrangement, <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s 233A</a> also imposes certain restrictions on termination because the law recognises the importance to companies of ensuring the continuation of essential supplies to facilitate either a rescue of the company, or a better return to creditors. Therefore the supply of key utilities are protected and from 1 October 2015 the government extended the list of essential supplies to include private suppliers of utilities and IT supplies (see Practice Note: <a href='#'>The Insolvency (Protection of Essential Supplies) Order 2015—what is its effect?</a>).\n</p>\n<p>However, the law prior to the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> had limitations and did not take account of the particular needs of individual businesses in determining what is an essential supply, which varies from business to business.</p>\n<p>Moreover, under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, ss 233</a>–<a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>233A</a> the guarantee of essential supplies is conditional: the office-holder can request the continuation of the essential supply, but the supplier can insist on a personal guarantee from the office-holder in respect of those future supplies.\n</p>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_836872'></mark>What are the changes to ipso facto clauses?</h2>\n<p>The <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a> seeks to provide companies in financial difficulties with a comprehensive toolkit to aid their survival. As such, it is more radical with regard to ipso facto clauses than its predecessor legislation and seeks to restrict the enforcement of termination clauses in a wider range of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Under new <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>IA 1986, s 233B</a>, suppliers of goods or services are unable to rely on contractual clauses allowing for termination in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency or restructuring. This includes not only where the counterparty is subject to an existing insolvency procedure, but also where the counterparty is subject to the new restructuring plan or moratorium created by the <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>CIGA 2020</a>. However, where the counterparty enters into a scheme of arrangement under <a class='remotelink' href='#' target='_parent'>Part 26</a> of the Companies Act 2006, ipso facto clauses will remain enforceable.\n</p>\n<p>The creditor is unable to insist on payment of pre-insolvency debts in order to secure future supplies, nor are they able to do ‘any other thing’ as a result of the insolvency or restructuring. For example, the creditor is prevented from increasing its prices or insisting on less favourable payment terms.</p>\n<p>The new provisions go further and prohibit the termination of a contract or supply where the creditor has a pre-existing right of termination which arose—but was not exercised by the creditor—before the relevant insolvency or restructuring commenced.</p>\n<p>The restrictions will remain in place throughout the duration of the insolvency procedure.

A number of these measures involve the receipt of funds directly from government or local government that are not expected to be paid back, ie grants rather than loans. For more detail on the schemes announced, see Practice Note: <a href='#'>Coronavirus (COVID-19) implications for tax lawyers</a>.</p>\n<p>Guidance relating to these schemes has always indicated that the recipients should treat these grants as taxable income because the grant is, in effect, replacing the income of the recipient that would otherwise have arisen.\n</p>\n<p>On 1 June 2020, the government published <a class='external' href='#' target='_blank' title='Opens in a new window'>draft legislation, tax information and impact note and explanatory notes</a> for consultation.

For analysis of the changes between the original and the amended version of the provisions, see News Analysis: <a href='#'>Finance Bill 2020—new clauses published on 25 June 2020—Taxation of coronavirus support payments</a>.</p>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_842861'></mark>Which business support grants are within the scope of these provisions?</h2>\n<p>The provision applies to ‘coronavirus support payments’ (CSPs).

It is noted in the explanatory notes that this would be because the business activities have ceased, most likely due to the effect of the pandemic. It is clear from the drafting that these payments are still treated as being ‘referable to the business’, but that they cannot be referable to activities of that business because of the particular circumstances of the pandemic. It is assumed that this is intended to prevent any concerns about whether or not a person is ‘carrying on a business’—in other circumstances, HMRC might argue that a company that owned a chain of restaurants but was not in fact open for business in any of them should not be treated as carrying on a business at all. \n</p>\n<p>The treatment of the CSP depends on the type of business the person carried on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the person was carrying on a trade or property business, the CSPs should be treated as post-cessation receipts—for this purpose:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>the post-cessation receipts are brought into account in accordance with the existing rules for such receipts in the income tax and corporation tax provisions, with the exception of the provisions (in each regime) that provide for the extent of the charge to tax—namely, that amounts are only chargeable as post-cessation receipts if they are not chargeable under any other provisions, and certain amounts relating to non-residents or arising from activities carried on outside the UK are not chargeable as post-cessation receipts, and\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>each of the post-cessation regimes has its own provision for dealing with allowable expenses during the relevant period, which broadly allows deductions for amounts that would have been allowable had the trade or business carried on, save for expenses that arise from the cessation itself\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the business was not a trade or property business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>the person receiving the CSP is to be treated as if they were still carrying on the business and the CSP must be treated as if it were referable to those activities and therefore brought into charge under draft paragraph 1(2), and\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>if the business incurs expenses that would have been deductible in calculating the profits of the business had the business been continuing, the amount brought into account in accordance with draft paragraph 1(2) is reduced by the amount of those expenses (except for amounts arising from ceasing to carry on the business, ie in line with the rules for post-cessation receipts)\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_842865'></mark>What is a business and what amounts are ‘referable’ to it?</h2>\n<p>Paragraphs 1–3 of the draft legislation relate only to persons who are carrying on a ‘business’. Business is defined non-exhaustively to include a trade, profession, vocation, UK or overseas property business and a business consisting wholly or mainly of making investments. This definition is important because the way in which the CSPs are treated depends on whether the payments are referable to activities of that business.\n</p>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Amounts referable to a business or business activities—interaction between paragraphs 1 and 2</h3>\n<p>Where the activities of the business have ceased at some point in the period of claim, it will be vital to consider how the provisions in paragraphs 1 and 2 interact with each other:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>para 1(3) requires the CSP not to be brought into account under para 1(2) if the business to which the amount is referable is no longer being carried out and the amount is not referable to activities of the business undertaken at the time that the business was being carried out by the recipient. This appears to be targeting a situation where:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>the business has ceased to be carried on at some point during the period to which the CSP relates (bearing in mind that some of the CSPs are one-off lump sums)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>the amount, or some of it, is not referable to activities of the business that was previously being carried on, eg a company claims amounts under the CJRS for April 2020 and, for the first two weeks of April, the business was still active and only half the workforce had been furloughed, but by mid April all staff had been furloughed and the business was closed completely. The amount paid in respect of the second half of April would not be referable to activities of the business that was previously being carried on (whereas the amount for the first half of April would be)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>in this situation, that part of the payment (ie that for the second half of April in the example above) needs to be brought into account, but:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>as a post-cessation receipt under paragraph 2(3) or (4), unless</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>it is brought back into account under paragraph 1(2) because the ceased business was not a trade, profession, vocation or property business</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm30'>\n<h3>Amounts referable to a business—specific situations</h3>\n<p>Paragraph 3 contains specific provisions to determine the amounts ‘referable to a business’ in certain specific situations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the CSP is made under the CJRS or CSSPRS (collectively known as ‘employment-related schemes’), it is treated as referable to the business of the person receiving the payment—this covers the situation where the person operating the pay as you earn (PAYE) scheme is a different person to the actual employer of the employees and makes it clear that the income must be brought into account in the hands of the person that receives the payment (and not another person, although note the application of paragraph 5 explained below)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>a CSP made under the SEISS is referable only to the business of the individual to whom the payment relates and is to be treated entirely as a receipt of a revenue nature of the 2020–21 tax year (irrespective of its accounting treatment), ie it is brought into account for tax purposes in the year in which the SEISS payments are received (and no element included in the 2019–2020 tax year (even though the SEISS was announced during 2019–2020 and some of the affected trading may have taken place in that tax year)). This is a welcome simplification for many self-employed people, because no allocation needs to be made of the SEISS payments between tax returns on their self-assessments\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>where a CSP is made to a partner under the SEISS, its treatment depends on whether the partner retains the payment or distributes it among the partners. The first draft made this differentiation based on whether the payment was retained in its entirety, whereas the current version deals with each ‘amount’ of a CSP, suggesting that the partner may retain part and distribute part. The treatment is as follows:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>any amount that is distributed among the partners (and not retained by the individual) is not treated as a receipt of a revenue nature of the individual partner, and </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>◦</span>\n<p>any amount that is retained by the individual partner is not treated as a receipt of the partnership or firm, in which case the amount is not included in the calculation of the firm’s profits, but rather added to the specific partner’s share of the firm’s profits (after those profits have been allocated in the usual way)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The implication of this provision is that where a partner receives an SEISS payment and does not retain it all, it would be expected to be treated as income of the business of the partnership in accordance with draft paragraphs 1 or 2 as appropriate</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_842866'></mark>Exemptions, reliefs and deductions</h2>\n<p>Under paragraph 4 of the schedule in the draft legislation, certain amounts are exempt or relieved as follows:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>if the payment relates only to the mutual activities of a business that carries on a mutual trade, it will be treated as income of the mutual activities and therefore not taxable\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>CSPs are ignored when carrying out the calculations for income limits for charities and community amateur sports clubs; and amounts received under employment-related schemes are ignored when considering the corporation tax exemptions for trading and property income of community amateur sports clubs\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>for the purposes of applying an individual’s trading allowance for the year, any CSP received under the SEISS and brought into account under paragraph 1(2) is not included in the person’s relevant income and no relief is given against it (meaning the full trading allowances remain to be used against actual trading income) (the original version of this provision referred to property allowances as well; these were removed on the second iteration, presumably because the SEISS relates to trading income, not property income), and\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>deductions for pre-trading employment expenses are disallowed where a CSP is made under the CJRS or CSSPRS\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section class='comm21'>\n<h2>\n<mark class='refpt' id='CITEID_842867'></mark>Charge on CJRS payments where employment costs are deductible by another</h2>\n<p>Paragraph 5 of the draft schedule sets out a specific charge to income tax (rather than a requirement to bring the amount of the CSP into the profit or post-cessation receipt calculations) for CSPs under the employment related schemes where two conditions are met:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>condition A: the amount of the CSP is not brought into account under paragraph 1(2) (in calculating the profits of a business carried on by the recipient of the CJRS or CSSPRS payment) or 2(3) or 2(4) (as a post-cessation receipt arising from the carrying on of such a business), and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class='label'>•</span>\n<p>condition B: expenses incurred by another person (ie not the person receiving the CJRS or CSSPRS payment) in respect of the same employment costs are deductible in calculating profits for income or corporation tax purposes (or post-cessation receipts)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where the above two conditions are met, income tax is charged on the whole amount of the relevant CSP and the person liable to pay that tax is the one entitled to receive the CSP as an employer.</p>\n<p>There is little guidance in the explanatory notes as to the target of this paragraph. It may be that this is designed to ensure that amounts paid under the CJRS to non-UK resident group members are still caught within the UK tax net. In an example: if a non-UK resident group member operates the PAYE scheme, it is that non-UK company that would be entitled to the payment under the CJRS in respect of employees working in the UK. However, as a non-UK resident company (assuming no other connection to the UK, such as a trading permanent establishment, that would bring it within the scope of the UK corporation tax or income tax net), it would not be caught by the requirements of paragraph 1 or 2. Where the employment costs for the furloughed employees are actually borne by a UK company (and therefore are deductible in calculating its trade), the UK exchequer would be losing out: they would have paid out the CJRS payment, be allowing deductions in the calculation of taxable profits of another entity, but no taxable income would be brought into account. Paragraph 5(5) states that the person liable to the income tax charge is the person entitled to receive the CSP as an employer, which would, in this example, be the non-UK recipient. If this kind of scenario is the intended target of this provision, it seems odd that HMRC have not elected to charge this income tax on the entity that is getting the related deductions, since that entity is (by definition) within the UK tax net, given the difficulties of enforcing UK tax charges on non-UK entities.
